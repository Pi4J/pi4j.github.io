## Pi4J Goes Beyond Raspberry Pi with Java 22's FFM API

*Nick Gritsenko (aka [DigitalSmile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-gritsenko/)) joined the Pi4J project recently with an interesting plugin that uses Java 22's Foreign Function & Memory API. His work could open up Pi4J to run on a significantly wider range of hardware than just Raspberry Pi.*

### About Nick

**Frank:** Thanks for joining the Pi4J community! What's your background?

**Nick:** I work at Yandex in the infrastructure department. We're actually discussing moving from classic x86 AMD64 systems to ARM or even RISC-V in our data centers. The hardware landscape is changing fast, and I think RISC-V will make serious progress in the next 10 years.

**Frank:** What brought you to Pi4J?

**Nick:** I was already working on [an FFM API-based GPIO library for Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/DigitalSmile/gpio), and it seemed like a perfect fit to become a Pi4J plugin. The thing is, with FFM we can make Pi4J work on any hardware that runs Linux... Orange Pi, RISC-V system-on-chips, whatever. The FFM API basically lifts the hardware abstraction above the Linux ecosystem level.

### What is the FFM API

**Frank:** Can you explain what the FFM API is for readers who haven't heard of it?

**Nick:** The Foreign Function & Memory API is part of the [OpenJDK Project Panama](https://openjdk.org/projects/panama/), which actually started way back in 2014. The big difference between FFM and traditional approaches like JNI, JNA, or JNR is huge: **you don't need to know C or C++**. As Java developers, why should we have to become C++ experts just to talk to native code?

The traditional approaches have two main problems. First, writing production-ready C++ code requires deep expertise - you can't learn that from some "C++ in 21 days" book. Second, all those abstraction layers create serious runtime overhead with multiple layers the JVM has to handle.

**Frank:** How is FFM different?

**Nick:** With FFM, you stay in pure Java. Not a single line of C or C++ in your application. You describe C structures using Java, and FFM handles the conversion. Since it's pure Java bytecode, the JIT compiler can optimize it properly, so you can use it safely in, for example, high-load Spring applications.

### How it Works with Pi4J

**Frank:** How does this work in practice?

**Nick:** If you look, for example, at the [sources of the GPIO package structures](https://github.com/Pi4J/pi4j/tree/develop/plugins/pi4j-plugin-ffm/src/main/java/com/pi4j/plugin/ffm/common/gpio/structs) I've created, they're Java representations of the C structures that describe how GPIO functionality works in Linux. You're building the same model that represents the C world, but in Java terms.

When you want to change a digital output state, you're calling `ioctl` directly from Java to the kernel. FFM automatically handles converting between Java objects and the native C world.

**Frank:** What about performance?

**Nick:** I've done measurements comparing the FFM implementation with existing Pi4J approaches. The results are impressive, as the removal of all the steps inbetween with JNI and JNA shows a big difference between the "old" implementation and the FFM plugin. Removing the abstraction layers brings big performance improvements.

### Challenges

**Frank:** Any downsides to FFM?

**Nick:** The main issue is crash handling. If something in the native code throws an exception, your entire JVM crashes - not just your application. This isn't unique to FFM though. The potential solution would be sandboxing, where native crashes wouldn't kill the whole JVM, but I haven't seen concrete plans for that yet.

**Frank:** How do you handle different hardware requirements?

**Nick:** This is important - I'm strictly against putting any Raspberry Pi-specific code directly in the FFM implementation. Everything should go through plugins. Pi4J already has a plugin system for providers, but I think we should extend this to hardware-specific things... plugins for Raspberry Pi, Orange Pi, RISC-V chips, etc.

The beauty of FFM is that it works with any hardware running Linux. We're not abandoning Raspberry Pi, but we can expand to other platforms much easier.

### Future Vision

**Frank:** Where do you see this going?

**Nick:** This opens up completely new possibilities. At work, we're already seeing the industry move toward ARM and RISC-V because Java runs much more efficiently on ARM than x86. With FFM, Pi4J can be part of that future across all these platforms.

The goal is making Pi4J truly platform-agnostic while keeping the ease of use Java developers expect. No more dealing with native libraries, compilation issues, or platform-specific builds.

**Frank:** Advice for developers who want to contribute?

**Nick:** The FFM learning curve isn't as steep as you might think. Once you understand the byte mathematics and how to map structures between Java and native worlds, it becomes straightforward - though I won't say it's just "copy and paste"!

I'd say about 70-80% of my time was spent understanding how FFM works. Once that clicked in my brain, development speeded up significantly.

### Getting Involved

**Frank:** How can the community help?

**Nick:** Testing is crucial. I've been working with a Raspberry Pi 5, and basic functionality like digital outputs works well. But we need testing across all providers to identify corner cases that only show up in real-world usage. We also need feedback from developers trying different hardware platforms. The more diverse our testing, the more robust the implementation becomes.
