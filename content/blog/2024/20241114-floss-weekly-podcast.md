Frank Delporte was a guest on the Floss Weekly podcast. He talked with Jonathan Bennett and David Ruggles about the Pi4J Project, the friendly Java libraries for the Raspberry Pi that expose GPIO, SPI, I2C, and other IO interfaces. Why would anyone want to use Java for the Pi? And whatâ€™s changed since the project started? You can find it in your favorite podcast app or watch the video here:
