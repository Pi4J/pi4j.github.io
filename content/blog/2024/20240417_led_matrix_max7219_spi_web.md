Roberto Marquez shared a project with us that uses Java to interface with a MAX7219 SPI device to control an LED matrix. It's inspired by the blog [Raspberry Pi and SPI 8Ã—8 LED matrix example with Java and Pi4j](https://www.hackerspacetech.com/raspberry-pi-and-spi-8x8-led-matrix-example-with-java-and-pi4j/), but differs in that it is Web-enabled via Spring Boot. This project is the starting point to create a weather station in combination with the BMP280, see [BME280 Sensor (temp, humidity, pressure) via Pi4J, I2C, and JBang](https://pi4j.com/examples/jbang/bme280_temperature_humidity_pressure/).

While working on his project, Roberto contributed extra LED character definitions for the [Pi4JLedMatrixSpi.java single-file application in the Pi4J V2 JBang project](https://github.com/Pi4J/pi4j-jbang/blob/main/Pi4JLedMatrixSpi.java).

## Demos

## Wiring

This demo project uses:

* Raspberry Pi 2 Model B V1.1 
* 8x8 LED Matrix with Max7219 SPI

Connections:

* DIN -> blue   -> MOSI -> header 19
* CS -> purple -> CE0  -> header 24
* CLK -> white  -> SCLK -> header 23
* VCC -> 5V ->  header 2
* GND -> ground -> header 9

## Project and Code
