As an open-source project it's very difficult to understand how much it's used "in the wild". The only stats we have, are the number of downloads from the Maven repository. So end of October I made a few screenshots to share here with the statistics including September 2024.

These are the numbers for all Pi4J libraries combined. Is this much? I have no clue as I can't compare it with a similar project. ;-)

What I notice is the quick pickup of a new version. For instance, for 2.6.1 which was released on 2024-07-29.

Another remarkable conclusion: there are a lot of Kotlin Pi4J users!
