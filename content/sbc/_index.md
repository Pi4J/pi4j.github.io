Most of the content on the Pi4J website focuses on the Raspberry Pi because that's where the history of the Pi4J project started. But there are many more Single Board Computers (SBCs) that can be used with Pi4J.

In this section you will find information about some of those SBCs, how to use them, and how to get started with Java(FX) and Pi4J on them.
