You can choose from a long list of Java versions and distributions if you use the 64-bit version of the Raspberry Pi Operating System. But this 64-bit OS is only available for Raspberry Pi board versions with an **ARMv7 or ARMv8** processor. 

## Board versions

### With ARMv6 processor

* Raspberry Pi 1 A and A+
* Raspberry Pi 1 B and B+
* Zero 1.2, 1.3 and W
* Compute Module 1

### With ARMv7 or ARMv8 processor

* Model A+, version 3
* Model B, version 2, 3, 4 and 5
* Zero 2 and 2W
* Compute Module, version 3, 4, and 5

## How to Check and Install Java

### Check the Current Version

You can check the installed Java version in the terminal. On a board with ARMv7 or ARMv8, with a correctly installed JDK, you will get this result:

```
$ java -version
openjdk version "11.0.3" 2019-04-16
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.3+7-post-Raspbian-5)
OpenJDK Server VM (build 11.0.3+7-post-Raspbian-5, mixed mode)
```

On an ARMv6 version, you will get an error:

```
$ java -version
Error occurred during initialization of VM
Server VM is only supported on ARMv7+ VFP
```

### Check your board version

If you are not sure which type of board you have, you can check this in the terminal with `cat /proc/cpuinfo`, for instance for a Raspberry Pi B+ 1.2:

```
$ cat /proc/cpuinfo

processor	: 0
model name	: ARMv6-compatible processor rev 7 (v6l)
BogoMIPS	: 697.95
Features	: half thumb fastmult vfp edsp java tls 
CPU implementer	: 0x41
CPU architecture: 7
CPU variant	: 0x0
CPU part	: 0xb76
CPU revision	: 7

Hardware	: BCM2835
Revision	: 0010
Serial		: 000000005f9ba615
Model		: Raspberry Pi Model B Plus Rev 1.2
```

### Running Java 21+ on Raspberry Pi Zero 2

Because of changes in OpenJDK 21 (and newer), Java applications have problems on the Raspberry Pi Zero 2, 64-bit OS. These are a few example error messages, but depending on your code, the message could be different:

```bash
$ java HelloWorld.java

An exception has occurred in the compiler ((version info not available)). Please file a bug against the Java compiler via the Java bug reporting page (https://bugreport.java.com) after checking the Bug Database (https://bugs.java.com) for duplicates. Include your program, the following diagnostic, and the parameters passed to the Java compiler in your report. Thank you.

java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: com/sun/tools/javac/processing/JavacProcessingEnvironment$DiscoveredProcessors
	at jdk.compiler/com.sun.tools.javac.processing.JavacProcessingEnvironment.initProcessorIterator(JavacProcessingEnvironment.java:331)
	...
	
$ javac HelloWorld.java

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.InternalError: Cannot find requested resource bundle for locale en_US
	at jdk.compiler/com.sun.tools.javac.util.JavacMessages.getBundles(JavacMessages.java:145)
	...
```

Until the root problem is fixed in OpenJDK, you can fix this problem by adding a few command-line options to disable the intrinsic that speeds up hash calculation. It contains a bug which only affects the ARM Cortex-A53 only. The code interpreter and JIT compiler are unaffected.

```bash
java -XX:+UnlockDiagnosticVMOptions -XX:-UseVectorizedHashCodeIntrinsic HelloWorld.java
Hello World
```

This will be fixed in the release of July 2025, based on the info in this bug report: [[AArch64] Incorrect result of VectorizedHashCode intrinsic on Cortex-A53](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8353237)

### Install Java 11 on ARMv6

The sources for Java are available as open-source on [OpenJDK](https://openjdk.java.net/), which means, if you can't find the correct version for a specific board, it is possible to compile it yourself. Luckily there are different suppliers providing ready-made packages of the JDK for multiple platforms. But only Azul seems to have one which is a perfect fit for Raspberry Pi's with an ARMv6: [the Zulu community edition of JDK 11](https://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu-community/?version=java-11-lts&os=linux&architecture=arm-32-bit-hf&package=jdk).

To get started with Zulu JDK, download and uncompress it to your board:

```
$ cd /usr/lib/jvm
$ sudo wget https://cdn.azul.com/zulu-embedded/bin/zulu11.41.75-ca-jdk11.0.8-linux_aarch32hf.tar.gz
$ sudo tar -xzvf zulu11.41.75-ca-jdk11.0.8-linux_aarch32hf.tar.gz
$ sudo rm zulu11.41.75-ca-jdk11.0.8-linux_aarch32hf.tar.gz
$ ls -l
total 12
lrwxrwxrwx  1 root root   21 Jul 23 15:58 java-1.11.0-openjdk-armhf -> java-11-openjdk-armhf
drwxr-xr-x  9 root root 4096 Aug 20 11:41 java-11-openjdk-armhf
drwxr-xr-x  2 root root 4096 Aug 20 11:41 openjdk-11
drwxrwxr-x 10  111  122 4096 Jul 10 16:50 zulu11.41.75-ca-jdk11.0.8-linux_aarch32hf
```

Now we have the JDK11 ready to be used, but it still needs to be configured, so the OS is aware of it.

```
$ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/java java /usr/lib/jvm/zulu11.41.75-ca-jdk11.0.8-linux_aarch32hf/bin/java 1
$ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/javac javac /usr/lib/jvm/zulu11.41.75-ca-jdk11.0.8-linux_aarch32hf/bin/javac 1
```

At this moment we can select the new JDK to link it to the “java” and “javac” command.

```
$ sudo update-alternatives --config java
There are 2 choices for the alternative java (providing /usr/bin/java).

  Selection    Path                                                             Priority   Status
------------------------------------------------------------

  1            /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-armhf/bin/java                       1111      manual mode
  2            /usr/lib/jvm/zulu11.41.75-ca-jdk11.0.8-linux_aarch32hf/bin/java   1         manual mode

update-alternatives: using /usr/lib/jvm/zulu11.41.75-ca-jdk11.0.8-linux_aarch32hf/bin/java to provide /usr/bin/java (java) in manual mode

$ sudo update-alternatives --config javac
There are 2 choices for the alternative javac (providing /usr/bin/javac).

  Selection    Path                                                              Priority   Status
------------------------------------------------------------
* 0            /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-armhf/bin/javac                       1111      auto mode
  1            /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-armhf/bin/javac                       1111      manual mode
  2            /usr/lib/jvm/zulu11.41.75-ca-jdk11.0.8-linux_aarch32hf/bin/javac   1         manual mode

Press <enter> to keep the current choice[*], or type selection number: 2
update-alternatives: using /usr/lib/jvm/zulu11.41.75-ca-jdk11.0.8-linux_aarch32hf/bin/javac to provide /usr/bin/javac (javac) in manual mode
```

Now let's check the Java version:

```
$ java -version
openjdk version "11.0.8" 2020-07-14 LTS
OpenJDK Runtime Environment Zulu11.41+75-CA (build 11.0.8+10-LTS)
OpenJDK Client VM Zulu11.41+75-CA (build 11.0.8+10-LTS, mixed mode)
```

OK, ready to run Java 11 applications on the Raspberry Pi with ARMv6!
