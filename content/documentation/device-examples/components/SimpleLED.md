### Description
The [simpleLED](https://github.com/Pi4J/pi4j-example-components/tree/main/src/main/java/com/pi4j/catalog) (src/main/java/com/pi4j/catalog) is a template class, that you can use in your own Java-project.

The template Class gives you the option to switch off, switch on or toggle the state of the LED.

### Code
A simple example on how to use the LED-Class from the [Hardware-Catalog](https://github.com/Pi4J/pi4j-example-components) :
```java
// Create a new SimpleLED component
SimpleLED led = new SimpleLED(pi4j, PIN.D26);

// Turn on the LED to have a defined state
led.setStateOn();
delay(1000);

// Make a flashing light by toggling the LED every second
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
	System.out.println(led.toggleState());
	delay(1000);
}

// That's all so turn off the relay and quit
led.setStateOff();
System.out.println("off");
delay(2000);
```
### Further application
The class is implemented in the two sample projects [Theremin](https://github.com/DieterHolz/RaspPiTheremin) and [Photobooth](https://github.com/DieterHolz/PhotoBooth).

### Further project ideas
- Use an infrared LED to establish communication with an infrared receiver.
- Use several red LEDs to recreate the running lights of KITT, the car from Knight Rider.
