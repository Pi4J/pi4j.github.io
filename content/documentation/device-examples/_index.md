The core Pi4J V.2 library doesn't contain any specific support for devices like buttons, motors, LCD... This was part of 
V.1 but made it much more difficult to maintain and fully test the library.

On this page we want to keep a list of projects which contain implementation code for specific devices using the Pi4J 
V.2 core library. Please let us know through [the forum](https://forum.pi4j.com) if you want to have your project added 
to this list.
