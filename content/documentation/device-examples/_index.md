The core Pi4J V.2 library doesn't contain any specific support for devices like buttons, motors, LCD... This was part of 
V.1 but made it much more difficult to maintain and fully test the library.


### Current code providers

| Provider         | Link              |

### Simple Implementation

For a simple implementation of a project with one of the components, the recommendation is to use the [Template-Project](https://github.com/Pi4J/pi4j-template-javafx).
The Readme.md describes how to get started with the project.
To get a better understanding, look at one of those finished template-projects: [Theremin](https://github.com/DieterHolz/RaspPiTheremin) or [Photobooth](https://github.com/DieterHolz/PhotoBooth)
