JBang allows you to execute Java code with dependencies as a single file without the need for a full Maven or Gradle project. You also don't need to compile your code. So it's a very easy way to get started with Java and Pi4J.

Multiple examples and more information is available in the section ["Example Implementations > JBang Examples"](/examples/jbang/).
