## Having fun with LED strips with Java on the Raspberry Pi

**20231012 - Live Stream**

{{< youtube eToIXACqSuY >}}

Frank Delporte and Robert von Burg (aka Eitch) take a look at examples using JBang and Pixelblaze, which are described on the Pi4J website at https://www.pi4j.com/examples/jbang/pixelblaze_output_expander/.

This was our first live stream using restream.io to see if we could create tutorials like this. This went smoothly for the first 44 minutes, and then I lost connection with Robert. But luckily, at that time, we had already explained almost everything we wanted to tell ;-)
