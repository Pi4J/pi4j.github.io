## Java, JavaFX, and electronics programming on the Raspberry Pi

**20210211 - PL JUGs United, Online**

{{< youtube J_Nigj0MfFk >}}

Java, JavaFX and a Raspberry Pi are an ideal combination for any project where you want to connect software and hardware (LEDs, buttons, sensors...) with a beautiful, easy-to-use user interface. In this talk, we will go through the process of building some example Java applications which use electronic components connected to a Raspberry Pi.

This includes selecting a Java JDK for Raspberry Pi, setting up a Mosquitto queue, understanding the GPIO’s on the Raspberry Pi and Pi4J, creating a JavaFX user interface, and a lot more.

Hardware experiments may seem challenging but with some basic knowledge and cheap components, you’ll discover it’s a great way to learn a lot of new stuff!
