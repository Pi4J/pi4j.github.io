## Java on the Raspberry Pi

To use Pi4J V3+ you'll need Java 21 or newer. 

Keep in mind this version is **only compatible with ARMv7 or higher** and doesn't support all 
Raspberry Pi board versions. If you have a Raspberry Pi A (version 3), B (version 2 or higher), 
or Compute (version 3 or higher), you are good to go! For all other boards you will need some additional steps 
that are described on ["Java for ARMv6/7/8"](/documentation/java-installation/).

If you prepared a microSD card with the latest version of Raspberry Pi OS (full version), as described on 
["Set up a new Raspberry Pi"](/getting-started/set-up-a-new-raspberry-pi/), you can check the installed Java version 
in the terminal. On a board with ARMv7 or ARMv8 you will get this result:

```shell
$ java -version
openjdk version "11.0.3" 2019-04-16
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 11.0.3+7-post-Raspbian-5)
OpenJDK Server VM (build 11.0.3+7-post-Raspbian-5, mixed mode)
```

If you get an error like below, you'll need to follow the steps described on ["Java for ARMv6/7/8"](/documentation/java-installation/).

```shell
$ java -version
Error occurred during initialization of VM
Server VM is only supported on ARMv7+ VFP
```

## Maven

Pi4J is using Maven as build tool, this allows you to compile your code with the required modules into JAR-file thanks 
to the pom.xml configuration file which you can find in the root of a project. We need to install Maven and can do this
with a single command, after which we can immediately check the installation by requesting the version:

```shell
$ sudo apt install maven
$ mvn -v
Apache Maven 3.6.0
Maven home: /usr/share/maven
```

## Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code (VSC) is the free IDE (Integrated Developer Environment) by Microsoft. It's designed as a universal
tool that you can use for multiple programming languages with extensions. On your Raspberry Pi open a web browser,
go to the ["VSC Download page (code.visualstudio.com/Download)"](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download) and 
select the "Linux .deb ARM" version.

When the download is finished, open a terminal, go to the Download directory and install the downloaded deb-file like this:

```shell
$ cd /home/pi/Downloads
$ sudo apt install ./code_1.53.0-1612367698_armhf.deb 
```

Since 02/2021 there is even an easier way, as Visual Studio Code is now available as a Raspberry Pi OS apt package. 
Use the following commands:

```shell
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install code -y
```
