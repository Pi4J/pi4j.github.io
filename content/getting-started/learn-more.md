And above all many simple examples on these and even more other topics: 
* The magic of Bits and Bytes and solving the confusion of Java signed values with the help of a led number display.
* Beautiful user interfaces made with JavaFX so you can interact with the hardware.
* Pi4J applications to be able to control different types of hardware like LEDs, buttons, displays, led strips, relay boards, and many more.
* Spring applications to interact with your Pi via web interfaces.
* How to set up a queue to send and receive messages to and from Arduino boards or other Piâ€™s.
* Interviews with Karen Mouws (STEM and diversity), Trisha Gee (IntelliJ IDEA), Xiaokai He (Visual Studio Code), 
  Alexander Belokrylov (BellSoft Liberica JDK), Jakob Jenkov (Java and tutorials.jenkov.com), Johan Vos (OpenJFX, JavaFX and GluonHQ),
  Gerrit Grunwald (Java, JavaFX, TilesFX), Mark Heckler (Spring), Vlad Mihalcea (JPA, Hibernate)
