The core Pi4J V2+ library doesn't contain any specific support for devices like buttons, motors, LCD... This was part of 
V1 but made the project much more difficult to maintain and fully test the library.

In this section, we want to provide you example implementations of several devices that are maintained by the community.

### Simple Implementation

For a simple implementation of a project with one of the components, the recommendation is to use the [Template-Project](https://github.com/Pi4J/pi4j-template-javafx).
The Readme.md describes how to get started with the project.
