## Project Status/Summary

Pi4J V2+ is a complete re-write and **does not maintain API compatibility** with previous 
versions.  It is not intended to be a drop-in replacement for previous versions of Pi4J.  Pi4J V2+ is 
a completely new **design bringing modern conventions, development practices, extensibility support 
and simplified integration experience** for Pi4J users.

This website aims to be the source of documentation for **all things Java on Raspberry Pi**. As such, you will not
only find info on Pi4J, but also **getting started examples** for basic Java Pi4J projects, JavaFX user interface 
applications, FXGL games, etc.

This is a true open-source project, meaning it **can only evolve, grow and improve by the support of the community**. 
Any idea, documentation improvement, bug fix... is greatly welcomed through the normal GitHub flow!
