**Daniel MÃ¥rtensson** used Java and Pi4J to turn an old Centrum U68 from 1940 into a MP3 player. The reason is because short wave, 
middle wave and long wave is today obsolete and not being used or sended today in Sweden. Also the electronics 
inside was a mess and very dangerous because it runs on both AC/DC current and all the wires began to lose their isolators.

Features: autoplaying next song, 60 songs included, volume tuning, song select, low power consumption, works with 
old Raspberry Pi's, terminal based.

With a Raspberry Pi B+, OpenJDK 8 and Pi4J inside this radio, it became a juke box. The sources are available on
