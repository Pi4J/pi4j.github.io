To prevent unnecessary code (tabs versus spaces, number of characters per line...) we have defined an [editorconfig](https://github.com/Pi4J/pi4j/blob/master/.editorconfig) for IntelliJ IDEA. You can find [more info here](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/configuring-code-style.html) about its use.
 
Some tips to keep the code clean and readable:
* Short methods with a clear name
* Use SonarLint to get improvement tips while code
* Use shortcuts
    * CTRL+ALT+L: Reformat code
    * CTRL+ALT+O: Optimize imports
