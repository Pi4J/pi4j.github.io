Pi4J is primarily built using Apache Maven and Java 11. Pi4J can be built directly on your host computer or inside a Docker container where all toolchains and dependencies are already installed, configuired and cached.
If you wish to build using a Docker container, please skip ahead to the Building with Docker topic.
Prerequsites In order to build Pi4J, the host system must have the following toolchains pre-installed.</description></item><item><title>Maven settings</title><link>https://pi4j.com/architecture/about-the-code/maven-settings/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/architecture/about-the-code/maven-settings/</guid><description>To simplify development but not commit sensitive information, you can add personal or PC-specific settings in the Maven settings.xml file. This file is stored or needs to be created in the &amp;ldquo;.m2&amp;rdquo; directory in your home directory:
Windows: C:\Users\YOUR_NAME.m2 Linux: /home/YOUR_NAME/.m2 Mac: /Users/YOUR_NAME/.m2 For more info see this article on Baeldung.
This is an example settings file, including settings for compiling of Pi4J and credentials to upload the generated code to a Raspberry Pi.</description></item><item><title>Code styling</title><link>https://pi4j.com/architecture/about-the-code/code-styling/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/architecture/about-the-code/code-styling/</guid><description>To prevent unnecessary code (tabs versus spaces, number of characters per line&amp;hellip;) we have defined an editorconfig for IntelliJ IDEA. You can find more info here about its use.
Some tips to keep the code clean and readable:
Short methods with a clear name Use SonarLint to get improvement tips while code Use shortcuts CTRL+ALT+L: Reformat code CTRL+ALT+O: Optimize imports</description></item><item><title>Hardware testing</title><link>https://pi4j.com/architecture/about-the-code/hardware-testing/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/architecture/about-the-code/hardware-testing/</guid><description>This is an experimental project which will need a lot of love&amp;hellip; The new Raspberry Pi Pico with a lot of GPIOs for a very low price, seems even to be a better fit for this project compared to the Arduino Due&amp;hellip; To be further investigated!
To minimize the required time and efforts to test a new release, V.2 aims to include an automated test which performs I/O testing on each I/O interface on each model of RPi.</description></item></channel></rss>
