Providers in the GpioD plugin:
gpiod-digital-input gpiod-digital-output The GpioD provider requires minimum kernel Bullseye 6.1.21 and Bookworm 6.6.22 !
If you get an error at startup with the following content, your OS is outdated for the GpioD implementation used in Pi4J:

The file based I2C provider opens /dev/i2c-1 using a RandomAccessFile to perform I2C reads and writes. The file based PWM provider opens /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip? using a RandomAccessFile to perform PWM operations.
The Linuxfs provider linuxfs-pwm requires minimum kernel Bullseye 6.1.21 and Bookworm 6.6.22 !
Providers in the LinuxFS plugin:

This implementation is developed/supported by a team separate of Pi4j. Pi4j is a consumer of that PiGpio work.
Pi5 At the present time the PiGpio implementation does not support the new Pi5 board. - This new Pi5 RP1 chip will require a large development effort. There is no known plan for this develoment.</description></item></channel></rss>
