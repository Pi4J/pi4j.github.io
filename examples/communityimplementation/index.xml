As shown in the BMP280 usage a chip maybe available mounted on a small circuit board where connection to the Pi requires only jumpers. But even this simple means has limits as connecting several chips when using a Pi case and maybe a cooling fan creates problems. In addition some chips are only available as a socket device where a 4-28 pin socket is required.</description></item><item><title>BMP280 Sensor</title><link>https://pi4j.com/examples/communityimplementation/bmp280/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/examples/communityimplementation/bmp280/</guid><description>Description The BMP280 is a Pressure and temperature sensor accessed via I2C or SPI. The BMP280 is a simple device that requires the connection of few wires to operate. Because of this simplicity the device can serve as a very easy project for initial Pi and Pi4j usage. This document will explain the more simple means to connect the sensor and access the device with existing software requiring no coding. The document will also explain minimal coding required to allow greater flexibility.</description></item></channel></rss>
