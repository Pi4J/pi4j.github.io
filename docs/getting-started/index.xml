A lot of this power is based on the operating system you use. For our &amp;ldquo;Getting Started&amp;rdquo; examples we will be using the &amp;ldquo;official Raspberry Pi OS&amp;rdquo; (formerly known as &amp;ldquo;Raspbian OS&amp;rdquo;) but there is a long list of other possibilities which is listed for example on the&amp;ldquo;Awesome Raspberry Pi&amp;rdquo; list on GitHub.
In this article we start with a brand new Raspberry Pi board.</description></item><item><title>Understanding the GPIO pins</title><link>https://pi4j.com/getting-started/understanding-the-pins/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/getting-started/understanding-the-pins/</guid><description>Connecting electronic components to the Pi is done via one or more of the pins in the so-called header. The number of pins has &amp;ldquo;grown&amp;rdquo; between the different Raspberry Pi board versions, but all recent ones have a 40-pin header. It&amp;rsquo;s of course important to be aware of the correct numbering to not correct components the wrong way.
Type of pins The pins have different uses
Power and ground Both 5V and 3.</description></item><item><title>Electrical Engineering</title><link>https://pi4j.com/getting-started/electricalengeneering/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/getting-started/electricalengeneering/</guid><description>Resistor dimensioning Resistors can be used for different effects. One application is to improve the stability of the application with PullUp and PullDown resistors. Another application is to use resistors to protect the PI against voltage peaks or short circuit currents.
PullUp PullDown In electronic logic circuits, a pull-up resistor or pull-down resistor is a resistor used to ensure a known state for a signal. It is typically used in combination with components such as switches and transistors, which physically interrupt the connection of subsequent components to ground or to VCC.</description></item><item><title>Java development with VSC</title><link>https://pi4j.com/getting-started/java-development-on-the-raspberry-pi-with-vsc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/getting-started/java-development-on-the-raspberry-pi-with-vsc/</guid><description>Java on the Raspberry Pi To use Pi4J V.2 you&amp;rsquo;ll need Java 11 or newer. Luckily this version is included in the current version of Raspberry Pi OS. In the release notes you can see that the version of 2019-06-20 includes OpenJDK Java 11:
2019-06-20: Based on Debian Buster Oracle Java 7 and 8 replaced with OpenJDK 11 But you will need to keep in mind this version is only compatible with ARMv7 or higher and doesn&amp;rsquo;t support all Raspberry Pi board versions.</description></item><item><title>Developing on a remote PC</title><link>https://pi4j.com/getting-started/developing-on-a-remote-pc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/getting-started/developing-on-a-remote-pc/</guid><description>GITHUB PROJECT: https://github.com/Pi4J/pi4j-maven-archetype
Developing Java programs using a remote PC workstation Writing your Java program, compiling and running it directly on the Raspberry Pi board as shown in the previous chapter is perfectly fine, of course, but there is an alternative way to arrange your developing laboratory, using a normal desktop computer as Remote Developing Workstation (RDW).
This Maven Archetype will give you a tool to generate Pi4J V.2 skeleton Java projects.</description></item><item><title>Minimal example application</title><link>https://pi4j.com/getting-started/minimal-example-application/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/getting-started/minimal-example-application/</guid><description>GITHUB PROJECT: https://github.com/Pi4J/pi4j-example-minimal
In the &amp;ldquo;pi4j-example-minimal&amp;rdquo; GitHub project you can find a project which contains the minimal code to control a digital input and output with Pi4J. The project is further described on this page. The application will toggle an LED on/off and each time you press the button, the toggling speed increases. When you have pushed the button 5 times, the application stops.
Wiring This minimal example application uses this wiring:</description></item><item><title>Minimal example as FAT JAR</title><link>https://pi4j.com/getting-started/minimal-example-application-fatjar/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/getting-started/minimal-example-application-fatjar/</guid><description>GITHUB PROJECT: https://github.com/Pi4J/pi4j-example-fatjar
The &amp;ldquo;Minimal example application&amp;rdquo; uses one LED and button to demonstrate the basic use of Pi4J V.2. When building that project with Maven, all the required Java modules are copied to the target/distribution directory. But a lot of developers like to produce a single, executable JAR that contains all dependencies, also known as a &amp;ldquo;FAT JAR&amp;rdquo;.
The repository &amp;ldquo;pi4j-example-fatjar&amp;rdquo; GitHub project contains a Maven project with identical wiring, dependencies and build command to the &amp;ldquo;Minimal example application&amp;rdquo;, but results in such a FAT JAR instead of separate Java modules.</description></item><item><title>User interface with JavaFX</title><link>https://pi4j.com/getting-started/user-interface-with-javafx/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/getting-started/user-interface-with-javafx/</guid><description>GITHUB PROJECT: https://github.com/Pi4J/pi4j-example-javafx
JavaFX is a framework to create user interfaces for desktop (Windows, Mac, Linux) and mobile phones. JavaFX is an opensource project which is documented on openjfx.io and the sources are available in this GitHub project.
The main goal of Java has always been to be able to create applications which are &amp;ldquo;write once, run everywhere&amp;rdquo;. JavaFX promises the same for Graphical User Interface applications.
Gluon is the main maintainer of the OpenJFX project and offers commercial support to companies who want to use JavaFX in critical applications.</description></item><item><title>JavaFX GUI and MVC template</title><link>https://pi4j.com/getting-started/javafx-mvc-template/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/getting-started/javafx-mvc-template/</guid><description>GITHUB PROJECT: https://github.com/Pi4J/pi4j-template-javafx
The FHNW University created a template project which is now part of the Pi4J example repositories.
The goal of this project is to:
Provide a clear step-by-step how to prepare your Raspberry Pi Provide multiple test and start applications Explain the use of a MVC-model (Model-View-Controller) to clearly split data, actions and user interface Explain the use of JUnit test Sources and info Please check the README of the sources of the project for a full description of the setup process of the Raspberry Pi and to fully understand the example applications and the MVC-model.</description></item><item><title>Learn more...</title><link>https://pi4j.com/getting-started/learn-more/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/getting-started/learn-more/</guid><description>Pi4J is used in a lot of projects, and you can find a lot of examples online.
