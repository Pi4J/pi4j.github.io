The template Class gives you the option to switch off, switch on or toggle the state of the LED.
Layout Code A simple example on how to use the LED-Class from the Hardware-Catalog :
// Create a new SimpleLED component SimpleLED led = new SimpleLED(pi4j, 26); // Turn on the LED to have a defined state led.</description></item><item><title>Joystick</title><link>https://pi4j.com/documentation/device-examples/joystick/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/documentation/device-examples/joystick/</guid><description>Description The Joystick (src/main/java/com/pi4j/example/components) is a template class, that you can use in your own Java-project.
