This scheme was incompatibility with other pin diagrams and pin numbering used by other development platforms and libraries.
As Pi4J V2 is build as a &amp;ldquo;pass thru library&amp;rdquo;, and uses PiGpio as the underlying framework, the more well-known BCM numbering is being used now.
This drawing shows the different numbers for WiringPi and BCM in a 40-pins Raspberry Pi header:</description></item><item><title>Java for ARMv6/7/8</title><link>https://test.pi4j.com/documentation/java-installation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://test.pi4j.com/documentation/java-installation/</guid><description>Raspberry Pi OS Full comes with Java 11 pre-installed. But this version only works on board-versions with an ARMv7 or ARMv8. In some cases you will need to do some additional steps to install a Java version which works on your board.

To include it in your project, add this Maven dependency:
&amp;lt;dependency&amp;gt; &amp;lt;groupId&amp;gt;org.slf4j&amp;lt;/groupId&amp;gt; &amp;lt;artifactId&amp;gt;slf4j-simple&amp;lt;/artifactId&amp;gt; &amp;lt;version&amp;gt;2.0.0-alpha0&amp;lt;/version&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/dependency&amp;gt; There are different ways to configure the logging output, as described on the SLF4J website, but the shortest is probably with this property in your main-method:
public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { // Configure default lolling level, accept a log level as the first program argument System.setProperty(&amp;quot;org.slf4j.simpleLogger.defaultLogLevel&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;INFO&amp;quot;); // Your code comes here }</description></item><item><title>Creating a Pi4J Context</title><link>https://test.pi4j.com/documentation/create-context/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://test.pi4j.com/documentation/create-context/</guid><description>The context is an immutable runtime object that holds the configured state and manages the lifecycle of a Pi4J instance. It includes all loaded plugins, providers, platforms, I/O instance registry, environmental configuration and runtime objects including executor thread pools, I/O event listeners, etc.
Terminating/destroying the context stops and releases all resources, threads, listeners, and provisioned I/O instances held by the context.
Version 1 was implemented using a static singleton, while version 2 uses a &amp;ldquo;Context&amp;rdquo; to avoid static singletons.</description></item><item><title>Building an I/O Instance</title><link>https://test.pi4j.com/documentation/build-io/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://test.pi4j.com/documentation/build-io/</guid><description>Your page content goes here.</description></item><item><title>Listening for I/O Events</title><link>https://test.pi4j.com/documentation/io-events/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://test.pi4j.com/documentation/io-events/</guid><description>Your page content goes here.</description></item><item><title>Devices examples</title><link>https://test.pi4j.com/documentation/device-examples/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://test.pi4j.com/documentation/device-examples/</guid><description>The core Pi4J V2 library doesn&amp;rsquo;t contain any specific support for devices like buttons, motors, LCD&amp;hellip; This was part of V1 but made it much more difficult to maintain and fully test the library.
On this page we want to keep a list of projects which contain implementation code for specific devices using the Pi4J V2 core library. Please let us know through the forum if you want to have your project added to this list.</description></item><item><title>I/O Registry</title><link>https://test.pi4j.com/documentation/registry/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://test.pi4j.com/documentation/registry/</guid><description>An additional V2 feature is an I/O registry where all I/O instances that have been created can be maintained, managed, re-accessed, etc. As the library keeps track of all the created I/O instances, they become publicly accessible through a registry where users can interrogate, iterate, identify and access all created I/O instances that Pi4J is managing.
This is very useful for add-ons/plugins that want to provide runtime information about the state of all I/O, for example a web app illustrating the current state of I/O.</description></item><item><title>Shutting down the Pi4J Context</title><link>https://test.pi4j.com/documentation/shutdown/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://test.pi4j.com/documentation/shutdown/</guid><description>At the end of our application, the context needs to be shutdown to release the I/O and clean up the used resources.
