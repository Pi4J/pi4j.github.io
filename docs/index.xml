A lot of this power is based on the operating system you use. For our &amp;ldquo;Getting Started&amp;rdquo; examples we will be using the &amp;ldquo;official Raspberry Pi OS&amp;rdquo; (formerly known as &amp;ldquo;Raspbian OS&amp;rdquo;) but there is a long list of other possibilities which is listed for example on the&amp;ldquo;Awesome Raspberry Pi&amp;rdquo; list on GitHub.
In this article we start with a brand new Raspberry Pi board.</description></item><item><title>What's New (V.2)</title><link>https://pi4j.com/about/new-in-v2/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/about/new-in-v2/</guid><description>What&amp;rsquo;s New in 2.0? Pi4J version 2.0 brings with it many new features, and an entirely new architecture that focuses on extensibility, simplified integration and a modern Java API including the following:

The number of pins has &amp;ldquo;grown&amp;rdquo; between the different Raspberry Pi board versions, but all recent ones have a 40-pin header. It&amp;rsquo;s of course important to be aware of the correct numbering to not correct components the wrong way.
Type of pins The pins have different uses

This scheme was incompatibility with other pin diagrams and pin numbering used by other development platforms and libraries.
As Pi4J V.2 is build as a &amp;ldquo;pass thru library&amp;rdquo;, and uses PiGpio as the underlying framework, the more well-known BCM numbering is being used now.

In the &amp;ldquo;pi4j-example-minimal&amp;rdquo; GitHub project you can find a project which contains the minimal code to control a digital input and output with Pi4J. The project is further described on this page. The application will toggle an LED on/off and each time you press the button, the toggling speed increases. When you have pushed the button 5 times, the application stops.

The &amp;ldquo;Minimal example application&amp;rdquo; uses one LED and button to demonstrate the basic use of Pi4J V2. When building that project with Maven, all the required Java modules are copied to the target/distribution directory. But a lot of developers like to produce a single, executable JAR that contains all dependencies, also known as a &amp;ldquo;FAT JAR&amp;rdquo;.
The repository &amp;ldquo;pi4j-example-fatjar&amp;rdquo; GitHub project contains a Maven project with identical wiring, dependencies and build command to the &amp;ldquo;Minimal example application&amp;rdquo;, but results in such a FAT JAR instead of separate Java modules.</description></item><item><title>Soft real time PLC</title><link>https://pi4j.com/featured-projects/soft-real-time-plc-written-in-strolch/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/featured-projects/soft-real-time-plc-written-in-strolch/</guid><description>Strolch is a framework for developing Software which has a different approach compared to Spring and other similar types of Java frameworks, as the model is defined as an abstract model, where you always have the same three types of objects: Resources, Orders and Activities.

It can control as many pumps as the RaspberryPi provides GPIO pins. For every pump that gets added to the system, the user has to provide the amount of time that that pump needs to pump one centiliter in milliseconds. The machine uses peristaltic pumps. So that number is perfectly accurate. The flow rate won&amp;rsquo;t vary over time.

About FAT JARs With Pi4J V1 you can create a so-called FAT JAR, which packages all the dependencies into one jar-file. That way it is very easy to build your project on one computer and distribute your application as a single file to one or more clients.
Because of the modular approach and how Pi4J V2 loads it dependencies at runtime, this approach can be achieved by using the maven-shade-plugin.</description></item><item><title>Build Java modules with Maven</title><link>https://pi4j.com/documentation/building/modules-maven/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/documentation/building/modules-maven/</guid><description>GITHUB PROJECT: https://github.com/Pi4J/pi4j-example-minimal
Because the Pi4J V2 project follows the modular approach of Java, the functionality of the framework has been split into different modules, each with their own responsibility.
The easiest way to start a new project, is to copy one of the example projects which include a full Maven pom.xml-file with all the required steps and configurations to build the project with all its modules into the target/distribution directory.</description></item><item><title>Build Java modules with Gradle</title><link>https://pi4j.com/documentation/building/modules-gradle/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/documentation/building/modules-gradle/</guid><description>GITHUB PROJECT: https://github.com/Pi4J/pi4j-example-minimal
The Pi4J V2 project itself uses Maven and most example projects also use this build tool. But if you prefer to use Gradle, you can start with a copy of the &amp;ldquo;Minimal example application&amp;rdquo; which includes all the required files to build with Gradle.
Use Gradle version 6.6 (or later) and Java 11 OpenJDK (or later). The Gradle wrapper is used as described on docs.gradle.org. The Gradle configuration file build.</description></item><item><title>Running Pi4J with JBang</title><link>https://pi4j.com/documentation/building/jbang/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/documentation/building/jbang/</guid><description>JBang project website: https://www.jbang.dev/

The template is created for a digital joystick with 4 directions (up, right, down, left) and as an option additionally with a push button in direction down. A suitable hardware component is: : Joystick
The template class allows to query the individual joystick positions and can trigger a simple event when the joystick swings out in a direction or when it returns to the center position.</description></item><item><title>Digital Input (GPIO)</title><link>https://pi4j.com/documentation/io-examples/digital-input/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/documentation/io-examples/digital-input/</guid><description>Similar to a digital output pin, a digital input translates an input value of 0V or 3.3V to the value false/true. This means any type of device which can toggle between 3.3V and 0V, can generate an input value to the Raspberry Pi. Here the most basic example is a toggle button. If you use other components, always check which is the voltage provided by the device. Or if you use a power pin from the Raspberry Pi itself, to use a 3.</description></item><item><title>Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)</title><link>https://pi4j.com/documentation/io-examples/pwm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/documentation/io-examples/pwm/</guid><description>What is it? The abbreviation PWM stands for &amp;ldquo;Pulse Width Modulation&amp;rdquo; and is also often referred to in German as pulse width modulation or pulse width modulation. This technology is used, among other things, to control servomotors and is also used, for example, for the fans of a regular computer.
With PWM, it is possible to control a component such as a motor no longer purely binary, i.e. off (0% power) or on (100% power), but to control them almost at will.</description></item><item><title>I²C Clock Stretching</title><link>https://pi4j.com/documentation/io-examples/i2c/clock-stretching/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/documentation/io-examples/i2c/clock-stretching/</guid><description>Clock Stretching Please be aware there are some hardware issues when using the Raspberry Pi with devices that expect to be able to use clock stretching, for more info see &amp;ldquo;Adventures in I2C: clock stretching on the Raspberry Pi&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;I2C stretch bug.

The Serial Peripheral Interface, abbreviated to SPI, is a bus system which enables communication between a main device (called “master”) and one or more secondary devices (called “slave”). A direct communication between all participants is not possible here, much more the master can choose at any time with which slave he would like to exchange data.
In order to address only one slave, a total of 3 signal lines are required, two of which are used for bidirectional data transmission and one as a clock generator for serial transmission.</description></item><item><title>Serial (UART/RS232)</title><link>https://pi4j.com/documentation/io-examples/serial/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/documentation/io-examples/serial/</guid><description>GITHUB PROJECT: https://github.com/Pi4J/pi4j-example-components/tree/main/src/main/java/com/pi4j/example/serial/gps
What is it? Serial communication can be used to transfer data between different boards, devices, etc. Data is transfered bit-by-bit in a sequence, through a single wire from a transmitter (= TX) to a receiver (= RX). On the receiver side the bits are combined to bytes.
When you need two-way communication, two wires are needed between RX and TX from both sides:
The communication between these two devices can happen in different ways:</description></item><item><title>The Pi4J Logo</title><link>https://pi4j.com/architecture/pi4j-logo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/architecture/pi4j-logo/</guid><description>GITHUB PROJECT: https://github.com/Pi4J/pi4j-logo

Next to the declarative approach, Java annotations are available for the configuration of I/O provisioning instead of the hard-coded approach offered in V.1.
This implementation still needs to be further fine-tuned and unified somehow to make things cleaner and more straightforward, but would provide a way to initialize a I/O for instance like this:</description></item><item><title>Dependency injection</title><link>https://pi4j.com/architecture/advanced/dependency-injection/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/architecture/advanced/dependency-injection/</guid><description>To simplify the initial V.2 version, the DI implementation has be removed so it could be refactored and extended later.

Along with the annotated I/O configuration the ability to support I/O provisioning via dependency injection also makes a lot of sense. There is some basic brute-force stuff working but this needs more work to make this a compatible implementation for Spring or CDI.</description></item><item><title>LinuxFS</title><link>https://pi4j.com/documentation/providers/linuxfs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/documentation/providers/linuxfs/</guid><description>The current implementation of the LinuxFS plugin implements a file based I2C provider.

By default Pi4J embeds these native libraries as resources inside the plugin&amp;rsquo;s JAR file. At runtime Pi4J extracts the native library into a temporary directory so the JVM can load the library from the filesystem. Upon termination the temporary file is automatically removed.
This automatic extration behavior works well for most users; however, there are certain edge cases where this may fail.</description></item><item><title>PiGpio</title><link>https://pi4j.com/documentation/providers/pigpio/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/documentation/providers/pigpio/</guid><description>The current implementation of the PiGpio exposes the GPIO functions available on the Raspberry Pi.
