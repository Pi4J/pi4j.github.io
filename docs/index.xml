Intro The Pi4J project wants to be the starting point for everyone who wants to use Java on the Raspberry Pi, being it a headless, JavaFX-user interface and/or GPIO-controller project.
Pi4J is intended to provide a friendly object-oriented I/O API and implementation libraries for Java Programmers to access the full I/O capabilities of the Raspberry Pi platform. This project abstracts the low-level native integration and interrupt monitoring to enable Java programmers to focus on implementing their application business logic.</description></item><item><title>Kotlin on the Raspberry Pi</title><link>https://pi4j.com/blog/2022/20221117_kotlin_on_raspberrypi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/blog/2022/20221117_kotlin_on_raspberrypi/</guid><description>by Muhammad Hashim
Intro Pi4J is considered the project that brought the JVM to the RaspberryPi.
It has been up for more than a decade allowing developers to write sophisticated, high-level, yet simple software on the RaspberryPi.
And we’re glad to make it even more simpler and powerful!
For quite some years now Kotlin has been a most welcome language in the JVM ecosystem and the modern development toolchain.
Many factors led to this great reality, most notable to me is Kotlin’s non-disruptive integration and seamless developer experience.</description></item><item><title>LED strip with Pi4J and JBang</title><link>https://pi4j.com/blog/2022/20221128_led_strip_with_jbang/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/blog/2022/20221128_led_strip_with_jbang/</guid><description>By Robert von Burg
Intro In an earlier post, JBang and Pi4J were used to control a LED and button connected to a Raspberry Pi.
This week Robert von Burg, one of the main contributors of the Pi4J project, shared on Mastodon another project where a LED strip is controlled via I2C.
This is the result, notice the Foojay.io startup artwork 😉

A lot of this power is based on the operating system you use. For our &amp;ldquo;Getting Started&amp;rdquo; examples we will be using the &amp;ldquo;official Raspberry Pi OS&amp;rdquo; (formerly known as &amp;ldquo;Raspbian OS&amp;rdquo;) but there is a long list of other possibilities which is listed for example on the&amp;ldquo;Awesome Raspberry Pi&amp;rdquo; list on GitHub.

The number of pins has &amp;ldquo;grown&amp;rdquo; between the different Raspberry Pi board versions, but all recent ones have a 40-pin header. It&amp;rsquo;s of course important to be aware of the correct numbering to not correct components the wrong way.
Type of pins The pins have different uses
Power and ground Both 5V and 3.</description></item><item><title>Electrical Engineering</title><link>https://pi4j.com/getting-started/electricalengeneering/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/getting-started/electricalengeneering/</guid><description>Resistor dimensioning Resistors can be used for different effects. One application is to improve the stability of the application with PullUp and PullDown resistors. Another application is to use resistors to protect the PI against voltage peaks or short circuit currents.
PullUp PullDown In electronic logic circuits, a pull-up resistor or pull-down resistor is a resistor used to ensure a known state for a signal. It is typically used in combination with components such as switches and transistors, which physically interrupt the connection of subsequent components to ground or to VCC.</description></item><item><title>Java development with VSC</title><link>https://pi4j.com/getting-started/java-development-on-the-raspberry-pi-with-vsc/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/getting-started/java-development-on-the-raspberry-pi-with-vsc/</guid><description>Java on the Raspberry Pi To use Pi4J V.2 you&amp;rsquo;ll need Java 11 or newer.

This scheme was incompatibility with other pin diagrams and pin numbering used by other development platforms and libraries.
As Pi4J V.2 is build as a &amp;ldquo;pass thru library&amp;rdquo;, and uses PiGpio as the underlying framework, the more well-known BCM numbering is being used now.
This drawing shows the different numbers for WiringPi and BCM in a 40-pins Raspberry Pi header:</description></item><item><title>Release Notes</title><link>https://pi4j.com/about/release-notes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/about/release-notes/</guid><description>All releases of Pi4J V.2 are listed on github.com/Pi4J/pi4j-v2/releases.

pi4jAsync { delay(100) // suspended call describe() } Inside pi4jAsync you have access to a newly created auto context and you can run your code in the provided CoroutineScope.
Custom CoroutineScope You can also use a custom CoroutineScope instance.

About FAT JARs With Pi4J V1 you can create a so-called FAT JAR, which packages all the dependencies into one jar-file. That way it is very easy to build your project on one computer and distribute your application as a single file to one or more clients.
Because of the modular approach and how Pi4J V.2 loads it dependencies at runtime, this approach can be achieved by using the maven-shade-plugin.</description></item><item><title>Build Java modules with Maven</title><link>https://pi4j.com/documentation/building/modules-maven/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/documentation/building/modules-maven/</guid><description>GITHUB PROJECT: https://github.com/Pi4J/pi4j-example-minimal
Because the Pi4J V.2 project follows the modular approach of Java, the functionality of the framework has been split into different modules, each with their own responsibility.

The Serial Peripheral Interface, abbreviated to SPI, is a bus system which enables communication between a main device (called “master”) and one or more secondary devices (called “slave”). A direct communication between all participants is not possible here, much more the master can choose at any time with which slave he would like to exchange data.
In order to address only one slave, a total of 3 signal lines are required, two of which are used for bidirectional data transmission and one as a clock generator for serial transmission.</description></item><item><title>Serial (UART/RS232)</title><link>https://pi4j.com/documentation/io-examples/serial/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/documentation/io-examples/serial/</guid><description>GITHUB PROJECT: https://github.com/Pi4J/pi4j-example-components/blob/main/src/main/java/com/pi4j/catalog/applications/SerialGps_App.java
What is it? Serial communication can be used to transfer data between different boards, devices, etc. Data is transfered bit-by-bit in a sequence, through a single wire from a transmitter (= TX) to a receiver (= RX). On the receiver side the bits are combined to bytes.
When you need two-way communication, two wires are needed between RX and TX from both sides:
The communication between these two devices can happen in different ways:</description></item><item><title>The Pi4J Logo</title><link>https://pi4j.com/architecture/pi4j-logo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/architecture/pi4j-logo/</guid><description>GITHUB PROJECT: https://github.com/Pi4J/pi4j-logo

By default Pi4J embeds these native libraries as resources inside the plugin&amp;rsquo;s JAR file. At runtime Pi4J extracts the native library into a temporary directory so the JVM can load the library from the filesystem. Upon termination the temporary file is automatically removed.
This automatic extration behavior works well for most users; however, there are certain edge cases where this may fail.</description></item><item><title>PiGpio</title><link>https://pi4j.com/documentation/providers/pigpio/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/documentation/providers/pigpio/</guid><description>The current implementation of the PiGpio exposes the GPIO functions available on the Raspberry Pi.

This will enable us to deliver a stable, fully tested framework as the number of features inside of Pi4J can be limited and support for specific I/O hardware can be provided with an extension for Pi4J.</description></item><item><title>Raspberry Pi</title><link>https://pi4j.com/documentation/platforms/raspberry-pi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/documentation/platforms/raspberry-pi/</guid><description>TODO</description></item><item><title>Remote support</title><link>https://pi4j.com/architecture/advanced/remote-support/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/architecture/advanced/remote-support/</guid><description>One of the big features on the wish-list for V.2: native support for remote I/O capability. Predominantly to support the ability for a user to perform development work on their desktop/laptop and be able to run their project with remote support slaving the I/O to a daemon running on the Raspberry Pi (or other supported SBC).
TO BE DECIDED: the V.2 codebase does support this currently by using the PiGpio daemon.</description></item></channel></rss>
