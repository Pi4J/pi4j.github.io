The abbreviation PWM stands for &amp;ldquo;Pulse Width Modulation&amp;rdquo; and is also often referred to in German as pulse width modulation or pulse duration modulation. This technology is used, among other things, to control servomotors and is also used, for example, for the fans of a regular computer.
With PWM, it is possible to control a component such as a motor no longer purely binary, i.e. off (0% power) or on (100% power), but to control them almost at will.</description></item></channel></rss>
