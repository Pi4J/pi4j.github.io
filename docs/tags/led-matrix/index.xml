Description The LedMatrix is a template class, that you can use in your own Java-project. It is an extension of the class LEDStrip. An LED matrix can be built from one LED strip. To do this, separate the LED strip at the desired point and place the individual strips under each other or next to each other.</description></item></channel></rss>
