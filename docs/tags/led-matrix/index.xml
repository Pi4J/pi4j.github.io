This example is explained in the following video:
Intro Before proceeding with this example, make sure that you have a Raspberry Pi prepared to execute Java code with JBang as explained here.
Wiring SPI requires four connections, but as we don&amp;rsquo;t read data back, we only connect three of them plus power and ground.</description></item><item><title>LED Matrix</title><link>https://pi4j.com/examples/components/ledmatrix/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/examples/components/ledmatrix/</guid><description>Although this example is still valid, an easier approach for the control of an array of LEDs can be achieved with the PixelBlaze Output Expander as described here.
Description The LedMatrix is a template class, that you can use in your own Java-project. It is an extension of the class LEDStrip. An LED matrix can be built from one LED strip. To do this, separate the LED strip at the desired point and place the individual strips under each other or next to each other.</description></item></channel></rss>
