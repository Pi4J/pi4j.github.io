The template class is created for an analog joystick, for example the KY-023, which consists of two potentiometers, one for the X-axis and one for the Y-axis. But any joystick with two potentiometers will meet the requirements.
The basic functions of the template class are:
return of a normalized value, optionally between 0 and 1 or between -1 and 1, of the X-axis and the Y-axis creation of simple events at a value change of the X-axis or the Y-axis, simple event handlers for button pressed, button depressed, while button is pressed calibration of the center position of the joystick (center position 0.</description></item></channel></rss>
