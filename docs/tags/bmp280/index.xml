The BMP280 is a simple device that requires the connection of few wires to operate. Because of this simplicity the device can serve as a very easy project for initial Pi and Pi4j usage. This document will explain the more simple means to connect the sensor and access the device with existing software requiring no coding. The document will also explain minimal coding required to allow greater flexibility.</description></item><item><title>BME280 Sensor</title><link>https://pi4j.com/examples/jbang/bme280_temperature_humidity_pressure/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/examples/jbang/bme280_temperature_humidity_pressure/</guid><description>BME280 Sensor (temp, humidity, pressure) via Pi4J, I2C, and JBang GITHUB PROJECT: github.com/Pi4J/pi4j-jbang &amp;gt; Pi4JTempHumPressI2C.java and github.com/Pi4J/pi4j-jbang &amp;gt; Pi4JTempHumPressSpi.java
Intro This is an example project to demonstrate how to read the temperature, humidity and pressure from a BME280 sensor, installed on an Adafruit board that can be controlled via I2C and SPI. Such a sensor itself is a very tiny component that can be integrated in phones and many other types of devices.</description></item></channel></rss>
