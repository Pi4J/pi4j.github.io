This example is explained in the following video:
Intro Before proceeding with this example, make sure that you have a Raspberry Pi prepared to execute Java code with JBang as explained here.
Wiring SPI requires four connections, but as we don&amp;rsquo;t read data back, we only connect three of them plus power and ground.</description></item><item><title>Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)</title><link>https://pi4j.com/documentation/io-examples/spi/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/documentation/io-examples/spi/</guid><description>What is it? The Serial Peripheral Interface, abbreviated to SPI, is a bus system which enables communication between a main device (called “master”) and one or more secondary devices (called “slave”). A direct communication between all participants is not possible here, much more the master can choose at any time with which slave he would like to exchange data.
In order to address only one slave, a total of 3 signal lines are required, two of which are used for bidirectional data transmission and one as a clock generator for serial transmission.</description></item></channel></rss>
