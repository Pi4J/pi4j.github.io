The fields are mapped as Parameter objects, of which the important primitives are available.

The reason is because short wave, middle wave and long wave is today obsolete and not being used or sended today in Sweden. Also the electronics inside was a mess and very dangerous because it runs on both AC/DC current and all the wires began to lose their isolators.

It can control as many pumps as the RaspberryPi provides GPIO pins. For every pump that gets added to the system, the user has to provide the amount of time that that pump needs to pump one centiliter in milliseconds. The machine uses peristaltic pumps. So that number is perfectly accurate. The flow rate won&amp;rsquo;t vary over time. It uses a relay board for closing the electronic circuit for all pumps.</description></item></channel></rss>
