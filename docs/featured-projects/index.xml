The fields are mapped as Parameter objects, of which the important primitives are available.

The reason is because short wave, middle wave and long wave is today obsolete and not being used or sended today in Sweden. Also the electronics inside was a mess and very dangerous because it runs on both AC/DC current and all the wires began to lose their isolators.
Features: autoplaying next song, 60 songs included, volume tuning, song select, low power consumption, works with old Raspberry Pi&amp;rsquo;s, terminal based.</description></item><item><title>Cocktail Maker</title><link>https://pi4j.com/featured-projects/cocktail-maker-by-alex9849/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/featured-projects/cocktail-maker-by-alex9849/</guid><description>The CocktailMaker is a cocktail mixing machine by Alexander Liggesmeyer. It can control as many pumps as the RaspberryPi provides GPIO pins. For every pump that gets added to the system, the user has to provide the amount of time that that pump needs to pump one centiliter in milliseconds. The machine uses peristaltic pumps. So that number is perfectly accurate. The flow rate won&amp;rsquo;t vary over time. It uses a relay board for closing the electronic circuit for all pumps.</description></item><item><title>Didier the street artist robot</title><link>https://pi4j.com/featured-projects/street-artist-robot/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/featured-projects/street-artist-robot/</guid><description>Meet &amp;ldquo;Didier&amp;rdquo; the street artist robot, a project by Duvam.

Requirements Raspberry Pi with arm processor (pi3, pi4, piZero) with a working java8 (preferred). Female-to-male jumper wires. Breadboard. Arduino Joystick module. MCP3008 IC (ADC &amp;ndash; other adcs may work too, but we are covering only MCP3008 here).</description></item></channel></rss>
