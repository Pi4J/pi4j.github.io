It is not intended to be a drop-in replacement for previous versions of Pi4J. Pi4J V.2 is a completely new design bringing modern conventions, development practices, extensibility support and simplified integration experience for Pi4J users.\nThis website aims to be the source of documentation for all things Java on Raspberry Pi. As such, you will not only find info on Pi4J, but also getting started examples for basic Java Pi4J projects, JavaFX user interface applications, FXGL games, etc.\nThis is a true open-source project, meaning it can only evolve, grow and improve by the support of the community.

Pi4J Parent POM  /pom.xml This is \u0026ldquo;the grandparent POM\u0026rdquo; and the place to build the entire project.  Pi4J Libraries  /libraries/* This folder contains (JNI native) libraries that Pi4J or Pi4J plugins may require for runtime. Libraries are not Pi4J extension, plugins, providers, platforms, etc. At this moment only a PiGpio library is included, but could be extended in the future. By isolation the native functions in libraries, the underlying I/O interface can easily be replaced later without breaking the core library.  Pi4J Libraries Parent POM  /libraries/pi4j-library/pom.xml Base library to be used when creating a new library. Contains the parent pom.xml-file for all library implementations.  Pi4J PiGPIO JNI Wrapper Library  /libraries/pi4j-library-pigpio This library is a Java library to wrap the PiGPIO API and implement the JNI layer to facilitate use of PiGPIO in Java. There is no Pi4J specific API or code in this library. This PiGPIO wrapper can be used directly without using the Pi4J-core but in that case your application highly depends on the methods of PiGPIO and will be very hard to refactor if you need to use another wrapper.  Pi4J Core Library  /pi4j-core This is the Pi4J V.2 API and core implementation of the framework and runtime. Doesn\u0026rsquo;t contain any actual I/O providers, platforms or IO/platform implementation \u0026ndash;\u0026gt; those are all provided via extensions/plugins.  Pi4J Unit/Integration Test  /pi4j-test This is intended to be a place for unit and integration tests to test the APIs and features. It only performs tests using MOCK I/O via the Mock IO Provider (plugin). It should not attempt to perform any real I/O testing.  Pi4J Plugins: the actual I/O providers, platforms and implementations  /plugins/* This folder contains any plugins for use with Pi4J such as IO providers, platforms, or extensions. Plugins must implement the Pi4J Plugin Interface (com.pi4j.extension.Plugin) and declare the implementation class using the \u0026ldquo;provides\u0026rdquo; directive in the module info class. See for an example in /plugins/pi4j-plugin-mock/src/main/java/module-info.java  Pi4J Libraries Parent POM  /plugins/pi4j-plugin/pom.xml* Base library to be used when creating a new plugin. Contains the parent pom.xml-file for all plugin implementations.  Pi4J LinuxFS Provider  /plugins/pi4j-plugin-linuxfs This plugin is intended to implement I/O Providers for Linux file system operations such as SERIAL, SPI, I2C and perhaps basic GPIO. This plugin is mostly empty at this moment. Goal is to have an I/O Provider which is totally independant of an underlying program.  Pi4J Mock Platform \u0026amp; Provider  /plugins/pi4j-plugin-mock This plugin implements both a Mock Platform and Mock I/O Providers for every I/O type supported by Pi4J. This Mock plugin is used by the unit and integration testing project.  Pi4J PiGPIO Provider  /plugins/pi4j-plugin-pigpio This plugin implements I/O Providers for every I/O type supported by the PiGPIO library. At this moment, this single plugin supports both ** local/native connectivity to PiGPIO ** remote (TCP) connectivity to PiGPIO ** TO BE DISCUSSED: Perhaps this should be separated into two plugins? Or moved to a separate \u0026ldquo;remote connectivity project\u0026rdquo;?  Pi4J RaspberryPi Platform \u0026amp; Provider  /plugins/pi4-plugin-raspberrypi This plugin is intended to implement the Provider for the Raspberry Pi models and declare the default I/O providers for each of the I/O types supported by each RPi model.  Pi4J WiringPi Provider  NOT IN THE PROJECT CODE This plugin was intended to implement I/O Providers for use with the WiringPi library, similar to the PiGPIO provider. However with the WiringPi project no longer being maintained publicly, this plugin was not implemented  Stand-alone projects Pi4J Test Harness  github.com/Pi4J/pi4j-test-harness This project contains the source code (both Java library and Arduino code) for the hardware test harness which has been created to eventually perform hardware testing at the physical layer to help speed up verification for each RPI hardware model Current state is very rough but functional. This project has been moved outside of the core project as this is only used for the validation test cycle before releasing a new version.

Pi4J version 2.0 brings with it many new features, and an entirely new architecture that focuses on extensibility, simplified integration and a modern Java API including the following:\n Fluent APIs/Interfaces Immutable Runtime Context Extensible Provider/Platform/Plug-in Architecture Builder-patterns for creating new I/O instances Well-documented source code Hardware PWM Support Java 11  Future plans:\n Dependency Injection via Pi4J Annotations Remote I/O Support (via TCP/IP)  In addition to the features listed above, Pi4J version 2.0 also abandons the old WiringPi pin numbering scheme in favor of the more traditional and commonly used Broadcom pin numbering scheme. This pin numbering scheme has been a source of confusion for a number of years, especially with beginners and is somewhat cumbersome to maintain as new Raspberry Pi models are introduces with differing or added GPIO pins. Moving forward, Pi4J will only use the Broadcom (BCM) pin numbering scheme.\nThe WiringPi project has now been deprecated (see wiringpi.com/wiringpi-deprecated/). Pi4J version 2.0 will no longer be based on WiringPi and has moved to using the PIGPIO library (http://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/) internally for low level integation. With this move, we will also support the remote I/O features (via TCP socket) offered by the PIGPIO daemon (http://abyz.me.uk/rpi/pigpio/pigpiod.html).\nWhat are the differences compared to V.1? Starting with the Pi4J 2.0 builds, the Pi4J project is prioritizing focus on providing Java programs access, control and communication with the core I/O capabilities of the Raspberry Pi platform. Earlier versions of Pi4J were perhaps too ambitious in scope and that led to significant project bloat to the point that the project was becoming unsustainable. The goal moving forward is to limit scope to that of the raw I/O capabilities of the Raspberry Pi platform and provide timely updates and releases for bug fixed and new RaspberryPi model introductions. Reducing the scope of the project should better serve the Java community for basic I/O access by reducing complexity.\nThe following features have been removed from the Pi4J library:\n IO Expanders \u0026ndash; IO expansion is still supported but concrete implementations should be provided outside the core Pi4J core project such that they can be maintained and extended independently. Other Platforms \u0026ndash; Other platforms such as Odroid, BananaPi, NanoPi, OrangePi, etc. have been removed and will no longer be supported. The challenge with supporting these additional platforms is that Pi4J depends on the underlying WiringPi project and WiringPi ports for these other platforms is not well supported by the various SoC vendors or community. The various WiringPi ports for these other platforms are also inconsistent causing inconsistent features and functionality of Pi4J. Additionally, regression testing of bug fixes and new features in Pi4J is compounded with each additional supported platform. Components \u0026amp; Devices \u0026ndash; Pi4J originally provided higher level interfaces for components and devices that provided an abstraction layer between real world devices (things) and lower-level I/O interfaces. While a noble goal, unfortunately this part of the project never received the attention and time that it deserved and never gained much adoption by the community. We are removing these to allow Pi4J to focus solely on the raw I/O supported by the Raspberry Pi platform.

It\u0026rsquo;s of course important to be aware of the correct numbering to not correct components the wrong way.\nType of pins The pins have different uses\nPower and ground Both 5V and 3.3V are available as power pins and, of course, also ground pins. Anytime the board is powered you have a fixed power supply available for your components. You have to take into account not to connect devices that need a lot of current, otherwise the Raspberry Pi itself will not behave as expected and reboot for instance.\nDigital GPIO The other ones are \u0026ldquo;General-Purpose Input/Output\u0026rdquo; (GPIO) pins. These pins can be addressed with software to act as input or output for an application. They use 3.3V, meaning an output pin will be set to 0V (low) or 3.3V (high) and an input pin will read 0V as low and 3.3V as high.\nMost of the GPIOs have an internal pull-up or pull-down resistor which can be enabled in software.\nOverview The following image gives you an overview of the pins and types of a typical 40-pin header. Note the different numbers being used:\n PIN: 1 to 40 logical order of the pin BCM: the number to be used in your Java code to specify the GPIO to be used. BCM refers to the \u0026ldquo;Broadcom SOC channel\u0026rdquo; number, which is the numbering inside the chip which is used on the Raspberry Pi. These numbers changed between board versions as you can see in the previous tables for the 26-pin header type 1 versus 2, and or not sequential. WPI: WiringPi number which was used by V.1 of Pi4J. The WiringPi numbering has a \u0026ldquo;historical reason\u0026rdquo;. When development for the very first Raspberry Pi\u0026rsquo;s was ongoing, only 8 pin-numbers were foreseen.

One application is to improve the stability of the application with PullUp and PullDown resistors. Another application is to use resistors to protect the PI against voltage peaks or short circuit currents.\nPullUp PullDown In electronic logic circuits, a pull-up resistor or pull-down resistor is a resistor used to ensure a known state for a signal. It is typically used in combination with components such as switches and transistors, which physically interrupt the connection of subsequent components to ground or to VCC. Closing the switch creates a direct connection to ground or VCC, but when the switch is open, the rest of the circuit would be left floating (i.e., it would have an indeterminate voltage).\nFor a switch that is used to connect a circuit to VCC (e.g., if the switch or button is used to transmit a \u0026ldquo;high\u0026rdquo; signal), a pull-down resistor connected between the circuit and ground ensures a well-defined ground voltage (i.e. logical low) across the remainder of the circuit when the switch is open. For a switch that is used to connect a circuit to ground, a pull-up resistor (connected between the circuit and VCC) ensures a well-defined voltage (i.e. VCC, or logical high) when the switch is open.\nThe size of the resistor can vary between 1kOhm and 100kOhm. Here it is necessary to weigh what is useful for the application. The closer the resistor is to 0, the stronger the level is defined, but the greater the current consumption in the open state. The higher the resistance, the less current is consumed in the off state, but the more unstable the signal becomes. For a start value PullUp and PullDown resistors with 10kOhm are to be used.\n    PullUp Pull Down Breadboard\n      PullUp electrical drawing\n      PullDown electrical drawing\n                               Voltage divider If components have a lower operating voltage than the 3.3V of the Raspberry Pi, a voltage divider can be used to achieve the desired voltage. For example, a red LED has an operating voltage of 1.8V. This means that 1.5V must drop across a second load. If we assume that the LED needs 20mA of current, this means that we should connect a resistor of 75 Ohm in series to the LED.\nIf the required current and the required voltage of the load are known, the exact required resistance can be calculated here.\n    Voltage Divider Breadboard\n      Voltage Divider electrical drawing\n    3.3V \u0026lt;\u0026ndash;\u0026gt; 5V level shifter To protect the Pi from 5V devices, a level shift/conversion can be done with the \u0026ldquo;Adafruit TXB0104 Bi-Directional Level Shifter\u0026rdquo; component. The bi-directional level shifter works for an I2C bus, for a TTL serial connection, for a slow \u0026lt;2MHz SPI connection and any other digital interface both uni- and bidirectional.\n    Logic Level Converter\n    Additional power supply If one or more large loads are required for the project, it may be necessary to use an additional power supply. A solution for this is the Mini Power Supply Module HW-131 Breadboard Power Module which provides two voltages 3.3V and 5V and a maximum output current of 700mA.\n    Mini Power Supply Module\n      Mini Power Supply Module Front Back\n    Do not use the USB port of the computer to power the electronics.

You can use it for your next Pi4j project and you will be able to develop your program on the remote workstation (RDW), compile them, transmit the executable code on the target Pi board and run it. You can also start a remote debugging session.\nThere are some pros. and cons. in such a developing arrangement:\n Pros:  Your RDW has much more resources like memory, disk capacity and CPU power than a Raspberry Pi, and this is true for a P4 model too. You can store all your programs in the desktop computer. You do not have to install on the Raspberry Pi the Visual Studio Code (or your preferred IDE program), the Java JDK (JRE it is enough), Maven and the other development tools. You do not need to connect the screen, the keyboard and the mouse to the Raspberry Pi You can use smaller PI models   Cons:  You can\u0026rsquo;t run Web applications (using a web container like Tomcat or similar)    Setting up Configure the RPi for Headless mode The Headless Mode configuration enables the RPi board to communicate with the RDW over SSH protocol.\nThese are the needed steps:\n Check if the RDW is equipped with a SSH Client. If the RDW OS is Linux you already have it For Windows you can use putty, MobaXterm or you can enable the (new) OpenSsh Client porting on Windows 10 Connect both the RPi and RDW to your local network Follow this guide to configure your RPi Install the Maven tool on the RDW  You should now be able to open a SSH Terminal window on RDW and to remotely login on the RPi board.\nInstall the raspimaven-archetype Goto the Github Pi4J Project and download the project clicking on the green Code button and selecting Download ZIP\n Unzip the archetype file in a FOLDER cd FOLDER/pi4j-maven-archetype-master mvn install  Congratulation ! - Now you are ready to generate your first Project Template\nGenerate a new Project Template Let suppose you want to begin the new wonderful PI4J V.2 project my-project, to do this follow these steps:\n mkdir my-project cd my-project mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeCatalog=local answer to the questions the archetype asks you (see below for details)  Configuring your new project Before starting the new project generation, the archetype asks some configuration data.

It creates a new auto Context object and uses it as a receiver for your lambda:\npi4j { // You have access to a newly created auto context  describe() } You don\u0026rsquo;t need to call shutdown(), it\u0026rsquo;s called automatically at the end of the block.\nYou can think of the pi4j block as your entire routine/ program.\nCustom Context You can build a custom context using the buildContext function:\nval ctx = buildContext { +MockPlatform() // add a platform to our context  +MockPwmProvider.newInstance() // add a provider to our context  +File(\u0026#34;tmp.txt\u0026#34;) // add a file property  +(\u0026#34;key\u0026#34; to \u0026#34;value\u0026#34;) // add a String property } You can add other properties the same way like InputStream, Reader, and Properties instances.\nGenerics You can also have access to Context properties using generics and type safe methods:\ncontext.run { hasPlatform\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;() // equivalent to Context::hasPlatform(Type::class.java)  hasProvider\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;() // equivalent to Context::hasProvider(Type::class.java)  provider\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;() // equivalent to Context::provider(Type::class.java) }  I/O You can easily create and configure I/O pins using this DSL\nDigital I/O From any Context object you can create I/O instances using:\ndigitalInput(address = 24) { name(\u0026#34;Button\u0026#34;) pull(PullResistance.PULL_DOWN) debounce(3000L) } digitalOutput(22) { name(\u0026#34;LED Flasher\u0026#34;) initial(DigitalState.LOW) } Using this DSL you get access to convenient functions like:\ndigitalInput(24).run { listen { // listens on state changes  val currentState = it.state() } onLow { // fires when state changes to DigitalState.LOW  } onHigh { // fires when state changes to DigitalState.High  } if (isLow) { // you get isLow property  } if (isHigh) { // you get isHigh property  } } Also, when you need to specify a provider for the pin you\u0026rsquo;re creating you can use these 2 safe providers:\ndigitalOutput(22) { mockProvider() // uses the mock provider  piGpioProvider() // uses the pi_gpio provider } Analog I/O There are common APIs between Analog I/O and Digital I/O like:\nanalogInput(address = 24) { name(\u0026#34;Button\u0026#34;) mockProvider() // uses the mock provider  piGpioProvider() // uses the pi_gpio provider }.run { listen { // listens on value changes  val currentValue = it.value() } } However, Analog I/O get their own unique treats:\nanalogOutput(24).run { whenInRange(0..5) { // fires when value is in the supplied range  } whenOutOfRange(0..5) { // fires when value is not in the supplied range  } onMin(0..5) { // fires when value changes to the minimum of the range  } onMax(0..5) { // fires when value changes to the maximum of the range  } } PWM PWM has its share of love as well:\npwm(address = 24) { frequency(10_000) dutyCycle(40) mockProvider() // uses the mock provider  piGpioProvider() // uses the pi_gpio provider }  Console Using the console function, you can create a Console object and use it to print output to the console:\nconsolse { +\u0026#34;This will be printed as a new line\u0026#34; box(\u0026#34;This will be printed inside a box\u0026#34;) +\u0026#34;Another line because I really like it\u0026#34; } You also get other helper functions found in the Minimal Example like printLoadedPlatforms, printDefaultPlatform , printProviders, and printRegistry.\n Platform There are some convenient functions added to the Platform API\nGenerics context.platform\u0026lt;MockPlatform\u0026gt;().run { hasProvider\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;() // equivalent to Platform::hasProvider(Type::class.java)  provider\u0026lt;T\u0026gt;() // equivalent to Platform::provider(Type::class.java)  createFrom\u0026lt;IO\u0026gt;(IOConfig\u0026lt;*\u0026gt;) // equivalent to Platform::create(IOConfig\u0026lt;*\u0026gt; ,IO::class.java)  createFrom\u0026lt;IO\u0026gt;(String) // equivalent to Platform::create(String ,IO::class.java) } "},{"uri":"https://pi4j.com/architecture/about-the-code/code-styling/","title":"Code styling","tags":[],"description":"","content":"To prevent unnecessary code (tabs versus spaces, number of characters per line\u0026hellip;) we have defined an editorconfig for IntelliJ IDEA.

We would love to hear from you!  Please let us know by sending an e-mail to frank at pi4j.com with a brief description, URL, links and pictures of the product or project you are working on.\n   Soft real time PLC  Strolch is a framework for developing Software which has a different approach compared to Spring and other similar types of Java frameworks, as the model is defined as an abstract model, where you always have the same three types of objects: Resources, Orders and Activities. The fields are mapped as Parameter objects, of which the important primitives are available. Conveyors for containers filled by a dispensing robot\n PiJukeBox  Daniel Mårtensson used Java and Pi4J to turn an old Centrum U68 from 1940 into a MP3 player. The reason is because short wave, middle wave and long wave is today obsolete and not being used or sended today in Sweden. Also the electronics inside was a mess and very dangerous because it runs on both AC/DC current and all the wires began to lose their isolators. Features: autoplaying next song, 60 songs included, volume tuning, song select, low power consumption, works with old Raspberry Pi\u0026rsquo;s, terminal based.\n Cocktail Maker  The CocktailMaker is a cocktail mixing machine by Alexander Liggesmeyer. It can control as many pumps as the RaspberryPi provides GPIO pins. For every pump that gets added to the system, the user has to provide the amount of time that that pump needs to pump one centiliter in milliseconds. The machine uses peristaltic pumps. So that number is perfectly accurate. The flow rate won\u0026rsquo;t vary over time. It uses a relay board for closing the electronic circuit for all pumps.\n Didier the street artist robot  Meet \u0026ldquo;Didier\u0026rdquo; the street artist robot, a project by Duvam. The sources are shared on github.com/duvamduvam/didier-java.  JMonkeyEngine with Joystick  Pavl G. created a Java Gradle library to control a car in a JMonkeyEngine game with an arduino joystick module connected to a Raspberry Pi4 model B, using GPIO digital pins and SPI interfacing through MCP3008 ADC (Analog~Digital Converter). Requirements Raspberry Pi with arm processor (pi3, pi4, piZero) with a working java8 (preferred). Female-to-male jumper wires. Breadboard. Arduino Joystick module. MCP3008 IC (ADC \u0026ndash; other adcs may work too, but we are covering only MCP3008 here).\n Sensor drivers  In case you want to read the data from various I2C sensors connected to Raspberry Pi the difficult part is usually writing a piece of code which talks to the I2C sensor. rpi-drivers is a Java library implementing simple APIs and communication code for some widely used I2C sensors. You can easily measure temperature, pressure and humidity, get ambient light intensity or measure voltage in your java Raspberry Pi projects.\n  "},{"uri":"https://pi4j.com/architecture/about-the-code/hardware-testing/","title":"Hardware testing","tags":[],"description":"","content":" This is an experimental project which will need a lot of love\u0026hellip; The new Raspberry Pi Pico with a lot of GPIOs for a very low price, seems even to be a better fit for this project compared to the Arduino Due\u0026hellip; To be further investigated!\n To minimize the required time and efforts to test a new release, V.2 aims to include an automated test which performs I/O testing on each I/O interface on each model of RPi. Ideally this would happen as part of the unit testing sequence for each code commit or at least as part of the release cycle.\nTo achieve this, an Arduino Due board with lots of on board I/O capability is being used. The firmware that gets loaded onto the Arduino board listens on the serial port for instructions on which pins to use and what type of test to perform. The \u0026ldquo;Test Harness\u0026rdquo; project also includes a Java library that is used to communicate with the Arduino and instrument tests.\nNext, a given I/O provider plugin includes test classes that instrument the test harness and perform live I/O testing between the SBC (or other hardware) and the Arduino Test Harness.\nTo be able to fully test all board types, a custom PCB needs to be created to perform all the interconnects between the Raspberry Pi 26-pin/40-pin headers, and the Arduino board. This way enough test harnesses could be build for each Raspberry Pi model and have a permanent setup for on-demand testing. This of course is a huge effort just by itself, and perhaps too ambitious \u0026ndash; but seeking a means to reach automated testing is really needed for the long term.\n"},{"uri":"https://pi4j.com/documentation/java-installation/","title":"Java for ARMv6/7/8","tags":[],"description":"","content":" Raspberry Pi OS Full comes with Java 11 pre-installed.

The project is further described on this page. The application will toggle an LED on/off and each time you press the button, the toggling speed increases. When you have pushed the button 5 times, the application stops.\n  Wiring This minimal example application uses this wiring:\nBuilding the application The main build tool used by the Pi4J project is Maven, but for this example we provided both the Maven and Gradle approach, so you can select the tool you prefer.\nMaven This project can be built with Apache Maven 3.6 (or later) and Java 11 OpenJDK (or later). These prerequisites must be installed prior to building this project as described on the previous pages. The following command can be used to download all project dependencies and compile the Java module. You can build this project directly on a Raspberry Pi with Java 11+.\nmvn clean package Gradle You can also use the Gradle Build Tool from these same sources. Use version 6.6 (or later) and Java 11 OpenJDK (or later). The Gradle wrapper is used as described on docs.gradle.org. The Gradle configuration file build.gradle-file is included in the sources.\nOn Linux:\n./gradlew build On Windows:\ngradlew.bat build Dependency in pom.xml For the Maven approach, a pom.xml file defines all the dependencies, and the build process.\nIn this project we will be using slf4 for logging, pi4j-core and the pi4j-plugins for the Raspberry Pi and PiGPIO.

The newAutoContext() method will automatically load all available Pi4J extensions found in the application\u0026rsquo;s classpath which may include Platforms and I/O Providers.\nvar pi4j = Pi4J.newAutoContext(); Output Pi4J Context information The library contains helper functions to output info about the available and used platforms and providers. To keep the example code clean, these are part of the PrintInfo.java class. For example to print the loaded platforms:\nPlatforms platforms = pi4j.platforms(); console.box(\u0026#34;Pi4J PLATFORMS\u0026#34;); console.println(); platforms.describe().print(System.out); console.println(); Handle the button presses To handle digital input events we first need a configuration for it. With that configuration, Pi4J can create the object for us and the state changes can be handled.\nAdditional info on the newConfigBuilder can be found on \u0026ldquo;Building an I/O Instance\u0026rdquo;.\nprivate static int pressCount = 0; private static final int PIN_BUTTON = 24; // PIN 18 = BCM 24  var buttonConfig = DigitalInput.newConfigBuilder(pi4j) .id(\u0026#34;button\u0026#34;) .name(\u0026#34;Press button\u0026#34;) .address(PIN_BUTTON) .pull(PullResistance.PULL_DOWN) .debounce(3000L) .provider(\u0026#34;pigpio-digital-input\u0026#34;); var button = pi4j.create(buttonConfig); button.addListener(e -\u0026gt; { if (e.state() == DigitalState.LOW) { pressCount++; console.println(\u0026#34;Button was pressed for the \u0026#34; + pressCount + \u0026#34;th time\u0026#34;); } }); Toggle a LED For the LED we use a similar approach with a configuration. The created led-object can be used to toggle its state.\nprivate static final int PIN_LED = 22; // PIN 15 = BCM 22  var ledConfig = DigitalOutput.newConfigBuilder(pi4j) .id(\u0026#34;led\u0026#34;) .name(\u0026#34;LED Flasher\u0026#34;) .address(PIN_LED) .shutdown(DigitalState.LOW) .initial(DigitalState.LOW) .provider(\u0026#34;pigpio-digital-output\u0026#34;); var led = pi4j.create(ledConfig); while (pressCount \u0026lt; 5) { if (led.equals(DigitalState.HIGH)) { led.low(); } else { led.high(); } Thread.sleep(500 / (pressCount + 1)); } Closing the application Before the application quits, we need to call the shutdown() function on the Pi4J static helper class. This will ensure that all I/O instances are properly shutdown, released by the system and shutdown in the appropriate manner. Termination will also ensure that any background threads/processes are cleanly shutdown and any used memory is returned to the system.\npi4j.shutdown(); Steps to run this application on your Raspberry Pi  Attach a LED and button as shown in the image above Use a recent Raspbian OS image which has Java 11.

Robert has a more than 20 year career working in the professional audio visual and home/commercial automation industry and an extensive background in developing technology solutions with a special focus on home automation and hardware/firmware/software integration. In 2012, Robert created the Pi4J project which provides Java developers an easy to use Java library enabling access to low-level I/O functionality (GPIO, I2C, SPI, Serial, etc.) of embedded systems like the Raspberry Pi. I created Pi4J to empower Java programmers to get involved with embedded platforms such as the Raspberry Pi and provide an easy to use and accessible Java-centric object-oriented library enabling control of real world (physical) \u0026ldquo;things\u0026rdquo;. Pi4J V.2 brings an entirely new and modern approach to Java I/O programming for embedded systems. I\u0026rsquo;m excited to get V.2 released and see what additional creative projects emerge.

Technical writer at Azul. Lead coach CoderDojo in Ieper, Belgium. Software developer with more than 25 years of experience in video, multimedia, technical project management, digital signage and (web) programming. I\u0026rsquo;m a strong believer in the power and fun of Java on the Raspberry Pi. My goal is to make it as easy as possible to get started for new and experienced Java developers who want to start there first hardware experiment. That was the reason I wrote a book about this subject and share my experiments on my blog and GitHub. Pi4J V.2 brings a lot of improvements to an already great project, and - just one example - the use of the BCM pin numbers will make it even a lot easier to use the GPIO\u0026rsquo;s. That\u0026rsquo;s why I join this great team to assist in delivering this V.2 and extend it further so we can bring even more Java to the Raspberry Pi.    Robert von Burg aka \u0026ldquo;Eitch\u0026rdquo;, Developer, Releaser.\nAs lead developer for strolch.li we use Raspberry Pi as our platform to connect with products, and to implement a PLC in Java. The Pi4J project allows us to encapsulate the low level aspects of communicating with the hardware, and stay in our preferred choice. The strolch.li/plc.html project allows us to also stay in the same DSL for writing server applications, as well as communicating with low level devices. Since I love open source projects, it felt natural to me to start investing time in the Pi4J projects to assist in the further development.    Thomas Aarts (aka Tom), Developer, Creating IC examples.\nMy previous work entailed a decade in Alaska involving HF through Microwave communication and airport Instrument Landing Systems (ILS) DME NDB VASI. The next decade was centered around telephony. Working for ‘ROLM’ I was a software engineer working on the CBX series of switches. Most years in assembler using the DG instruction set. Later years on the larger CBX that used a company designed compiler much like ‘C’ on a much different instruction set. The last two decades I worked within an IBM lab. At the start I worked the AS400, a mid to large size server. Initially development of software at the user interface, above the MI. After a few years I moved in the firmware stack at the time all the servers, mid-mainframe, changed to using the IBM RISC processor. After some years in the firmware stack I moved to a newly formed simulation team. This entailed developing a simulation of the entire central processor complex (CPC) or Central Electronic Complex (CEC) to enable the firmware stack to boot and the partitions to boot on top and run. So after a long time working just above the hardware or simulating the hardware I found the Pi4j project of interest. After its’ use for some sensors and displays I am spending more time learning its capability and if possible offer something to the project. After that by decade history rundown I should add I retired.

Follow these steps to get started quickly with this CrowPi OS.\nInstall the Raspberry Pi Imager The official Imager Tool can be downloaded directly from the Raspberry Pi website. This simple tool works on all common operating systems and can be installed very easily with just a few keystrokes. More detailed instructions for installation are also available on the homepage of the Raspberry Pi website or here on \u0026ldquo;Set up a new Raspberry Pi\u0026rdquo;.\nDownload the CrowPi Image The image for the CrowPi OS which contains the operating system for the Raspberry PI can be obtained directly from the Github repository of the CrowPi example project. The latest release of the operating system can be found under this link: Download CrowPi Image.\n   GitHub Download CrowPi OS Image\n    The image can then be downloaded from GitHub here: GitHub Download CrowPi Image\nAfter the download, unzip the .zip archive. Everything is now ready for the next step!\nWriting the image to an SD card When the image is written to the SD card, all data that is still on it will be overwritten!\n First, the SD card must be available as a drive on the computer. There are different possibilities for this. Card readers are just as suitable as USB adapters. The Raspberry Pi Imager tool is now started. First, the operating system must be selected. Press the button \u0026ldquo;Choose OS\u0026rdquo;.\n   Choose OS in Imager Tool\n    At the bottom of the list, select \u0026ldquo;Use custom\u0026rdquo;. In the selection dialog, select the previously downloaded and unzipped crowpi.img.\n   Use custom in Imager Tool\n    The second step is to select the SD card. To do this, press the button \u0026ldquo;Choose storage\u0026rdquo;. It automatically shows you only the available removable media such as USB sticks or SD cards. It is now very important to select the correct entry in order to avoid unwanted data loss. On Windows, the drive letter that is actually affected is shown under the data carrier, so that this can be easily checked in Explorer. In case of doubt, however, simply unplug the data carrier with important media beforehand so that nothing can happen.\n    TODO picture select SD card\nEverything is ready to write the image to the SD card. The process can be started by pressing the \u0026ldquo;Write\u0026rdquo; button. Another confirmation dialog follows before the SD card is finally overwritten. Writing the image to the SD card can take a few minutes which is completely normal. As soon as the process is completed, a message appears. The SD card can now be removed from the computer.\nInsert the SD card into the Raspberry Pi To insert the prepared SD card into the CrowPi, the 4 retaining screws may have to be loosened. These can be found here:\n    Raspberry Pi in the CrowPi with marked screws\n    After loosening the screws, the Raspberry Pi can be lifted. At most, a few cables must be unplugged. The SD card slot can now be found on the underside. Here the SD card with the contact surfaces can be inserted in the Raspberry Pi. The slot is marked again in the picture below. As soon as the SD card is inserted, the Raspberry Pi can be correctly installed in the CrowPi and any cables that may have been disconnected can be plugged in again. As soon as everything is back in its place, the CrowPi can be connected to the power.\n   Raspberry Pi SD card slot\n    Before the CrowPi is put into operation, it should be checked again whether all 3 cables are connected to the Raspberry Pi. The HDMI adapter on the left, the USB cable on the lower side and the GPIO ribbon cable on the right should be connected. These mandatory cables are framed with red circles in the next graphic. Optionally, a keyboard and mouse can be connected via USB, which is marked with a pink circle below:\n   Raspberry Pi cables\n    Establish the network connection Only the network connection of the freshly started Raspberry Pi still has to be made manually. Otherwise, all settings are already optimally contained in the FHNW CrowPi image. Now there are a few options for the network connection:\n Connection via WLAN Connection via Ethernet cable (DHCP) Connection via Ethernet cable directly to the computer  The easiest way to make the settings is to use the mouse and keyboard connected to the Raspberry Pi. Setting up via WLAN is explicitly recommended, as it can be used in almost any environment and works great with the hotspot function on your own smartphone even when you are out and about.\nIn the following, only the connection via WLAN is described, however, if there is expertise in this area, a connection via cable can also be established.\nEstablishing a WLAN connection To connect via wireless network, the two arrows on the desktop of the CrowPi must be pressed on the top right, after which you can select the desired network. Then enter the corresponding password in the dialog for secure connections. A few seconds after the connection, the CrowPi\u0026rsquo;s background image will automatically update and display the assigned IP address. An Ethernet address is also visible on the images. This means that at the moment of the recording there was also an Ethernet cable connected to the Raspberry Pi. Now that we have a network connection to the CrowPi, we are ready to set up the development environment as the next step.\n    CrowPi OS select WLAN\n      CrowPi OS WLAN password\n      CrowPi OS background with IP addresses\n                               "},{"uri":"https://pi4j.com/getting-started/crowpi/develop-with-intellij/","title":"Develop with Intellij IDEA","tags":["CrowPi"],"description":"","content":"In this tutorial, IntelliJ IDEA is used for the development. The articles, instructions and pictures are created accordingly. IntelliJ IDEA is from available Jetbrains in different versions. The community version has enough functionality for development with the CrowPi and is available for Windows, MacOS and Linux, but NOT for Raspberry Pi. The download can be found here.\nThe subsequent setup of IntelliJ IDEA is identical on all platforms.\nClone the repository As soon as we have installed the development environment, it is time to clone the entry-level project for the CrowPi. The source code can be found on GitHub. In order to clone the repository, the corresponding link must be copied on GitHub and then imported into IntelliJ IDEA. Now step-by-step in pictures a more detailed instruction.\nVisit CrowPi on GitHub and copy the link to clone as described in the picture.\n    CrowPi source link\n                               Import the project In the start window of IntelliJ is the option Get from VCS available. This must be selected so that the code can be cloned directly from GitHub. Then you can simply paste the link that was previously copied from GitHub. By confirming with Clone the process is started and any necessary authentication of the user is carried out. Simply follow the instructions of the tool.\n   Import from VCS\n      Insert import from VCS link\n    As soon as the project has been completely cloned on the local computer, the project opens automatically in the development environment. A small dialog pops up at the bottom right. This must be confirmed so that the repository can be properly initialized. Maven is a software project management tool, more information can be found in the Apache Maven Project. Basically, however, nothing needs to be changed. The CrowPi project already offers a complete setup and is easy to use.\n   Import Maven Project\n    Importing the Maven project triggers a security warning at IntelliJ. Click on \u0026ldquo;Trust project\u0026rdquo; to confirmed when you downloaded the soruces from the official Pi4J CrowPi repository.\n   Trust Project confirmation\n    Now a last import step. To be able to better research errors or understand how the code of the dependencies works, the \u0026ldquo;Maven Sources and Documentation\u0026rdquo; must be downloaded. This can be done with a few clicks. Open the Maven project menu on the far right. Click on \u0026ldquo;Download Sources and/or Documentation\u0026rdquo;. Then in the context menu \u0026ldquo;Download Sources and Documentation\u0026rdquo;. Now all used libraries are locally available and visible.\n   Download Dependencies and Sources\n    Now only the start configuration of the project is missing, which is described in the next section.\nSetting the run configuration The CrowPi project uses 3 run configurations. These define which parts of the code are executed and how. However, there is no need to worry, because most of it is already predefined and all you have to do is enter the IP address of your Raspberry Pi to push and run the code from your PC to the Pi. The following configurations are used:\n crowpi-examples [install] crowpi-examples [debug] Remote Debug  With \u0026ldquo;crowpi-examples [install]\u0026rdquo; the current code is copied to the Raspberry Pi. This works via a combination of SSH/SCP. The copied code is then started on the Raspberry Pi. \u0026ldquo;crowpi-examples [debug]\u0026rdquo; does the same, but other options are selected during the connection, and a debugger is waiting until the application is actually executed. \u0026ldquo;Remote Debug\u0026rdquo; provides exactly this debugger. This connects to the Raspberry Pi and troubleshooting can begin.\nTo make everything work smoothly, the IP address of the Raspberry Pi must first be configured. To do this, click here and select \u0026ldquo;Edit Configurations\u0026rdquo;. As explained before, the IP address of the Raspberry Pi is displayed on the background image of CrowPi.\n   Select configuration menu\n    The dialog for setting the configurations now opens. A little hint: wherever the IP address of the Raspberry Pi is required, there is already a placeholder \u0026ldquo;Add CrowPi IP here\u0026rdquo;.\nDepending on the configuration of your Raspberry Pi, you may need to define one of this available properties:\n crowpi.remote.port, default 22 crowpi.remote.username, default pi crowpi.remote.password, default pi crowpi.remote.target, default ??? crowpi.launcher.class, default ??? crowpi.launcher.args, default ???  crowpi.remote.host specifies the IP/hostname of the CrowPi, defaults to empty crowpi.remote.port defaults to 22 and specifies the SSH server port crowpi.remote.username defaults to pi crowpi.remote.password defaults to crowpi (this deviates from the Raspberry Pi OS default which is raspberry) crowpi.remote.target is the destination folder on the CrowPi where the compiled JAR files are copied to before execution and defaults to /home/pi/deploy (auto-created if missing) crowpi.launcher.class is the class path which should get launched by the JVM, defaults to com.pi4j.crowpi/com.pi4j.crowpi.Launcher and should not be changed (warranty void if you do so :wink:) crowpi.launcher.args are the arguments passed to the application launched by the JVM, specified as a string, passed through as-is without quoting, so e.g. BuzzerApp to launch that directly. Defaults to empty / no args.\nThe first five are only needed for remote deployments. Leaving crowpi.remote.host empty triggers local deployment.\nThere is also crowpi.remote.jvmOptions if you want to add any custom JVM options, defaults to empty or options for remote debug if Maven profile debug is used (edited)\n   The three configurations\n    First we configure \u0026ldquo;crowpi-examples [debug]\u0026rdquo;. For this, as in the picture, go to the tab \u0026ldquo;Runner\u0026rdquo; open and double click on \u0026ldquo;Add CrowPi IP here\u0026rdquo;. The dialog window to provide the IP address opens. Confirm with \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo; and press \u0026ldquo;Apply\u0026rdquo; to save.\n   Settings debug\n    Now we can configure \u0026ldquo;crowpi-examples [install]\u0026rdquo;. This works exactly the same as \u0026ldquo;crowpi-examples [debug]\u0026rdquo;. The same setting is required. Again use \u0026ldquo;Apply\u0026rdquo; to save.\n   Settings Install\n    Now the last configuration for \u0026ldquo;Remote Debug\u0026rdquo;. The menu is a bit different here. However, it is easier to use than the previous ones. Add the IP Address in the \u0026ldquo;Host\u0026rdquo; field. With \u0026ldquo;OK\u0026rdquo; the setting is finished.\n   Remote Debug Settings\n    First test run Everything is set up to start the CrowPi project for the first time directly from the development environment. Select the run configuration \u0026ldquo;crowpi-examples [install]\u0026rdquo;. Then start the application by pressing the green play button.\n   Start the application\n    It immediately opens the \u0026ldquo;Run\u0026rdquo; window in IntelliJ IDEA. It takes a moment, and some text is displayed on the command line. After a few seconds the output stops, and it looks like this:\n   Run Output in IntelliJ\n    A number can now be typed in here according to the displayed list (+ Enter). The corresponding sample application is then executed. If there are still error messages in the command line, it is worth checking the network connection of the computer and the Raspberry Pi again.\n"},{"uri":"https://pi4j.com/featured-projects/cocktail-maker-by-alex9849/","title":"Cocktail Maker","tags":[],"description":"","content":"The CocktailMaker is a cocktail mixing machine by Alexander Liggesmeyer. It can control as many pumps as the RaspberryPi provides GPIO pins. For every pump that gets added to the system, the user has to provide the amount of time that that pump needs to pump one centiliter in milliseconds. The machine uses peristaltic pumps. So that number is perfectly accurate. The flow rate won\u0026rsquo;t vary over time. It uses a relay board for closing the electronic circuit for all pumps. This allows to power the pumps with more than 5V. The relay board is connected to the Pi which controls the board with Pi4J V1. The backend-application is written in Java (Spring boot). The frontend is written with VueJS.\n                                                                     A video is available on Reddit\nApplication features  Pumping ingredients in sequential order. Pumping ingredients concurrently and mixing them by spreading the active pump timings within the productionstep. Ingredients that cannot be added automatically (maybe because they didn\u0026rsquo;t get assigned to one pump or are simply not liquid) can be handled. If a recipe with a non-pumpable ingredient got ordered the application will prompt the user to add that ingredient at the corresponding point. Recipes can be resized for every order. The user decides the size of the cocktail he wants to order. All ingredients amount will get recalculated automatically. A drag \u0026amp; drop recipe editor. Recipes can be categorized. Collections: Users can create collections and add recipes to them. Bar: Users can add owned ingredients to their bar. The application can search for recipes that he can order with the owned recipes. If the user tries to order a recipe where he doesn\u0026rsquo;t own all ingredients he will get a warning. The cocktail maker can search for recipes that can be produced fully automatic. (Won\u0026rsquo;t require the user to add ingredients manually) Recipes can be searched by ingredients. Multiple users \u0026amp; permission system: The admin can create new users and assign them to predefined groups, that have different permissions. Track the remaining amount of liquid of the connected bottles and prevent an order if the remaining liquid doesn\u0026rsquo;t reach. It is also able to switch between pumps on the fly. If one order empties one bottle, but another bottle with the same ingredient is connected, the application will empty the first container and will switch to the second one mid-production.  Docker deployment The whole application can be deployed as a docker container that has to be started in privileged mode. This allows even beginners that don\u0026rsquo;t have much experience to build their own machine.\nSources The full sources are available on GitHub\n"},{"uri":"https://pi4j.com/documentation/create-context/","title":"Creating a Pi4J Context","tags":[],"description":"","content":"The context is an immutable runtime object that holds the configured state and manages the lifecycle of a Pi4J instance.

Female-to-male jumper wires. Breadboard. Arduino Joystick module. MCP3008 IC (ADC \u0026ndash; other adcs may work too, but we are covering only MCP3008 here). Some patience and time.  Difference between Analog and Digital signals?  An analog signal is a continuously variable voltage between 0 and Vmax over time, examples : Temperature sensor output, Potentiometers (joysticks)\u0026hellip;. A digital signal is rather a discrete step-by-step output voltage of LOW (fall) to HIGH (rise) according to the switch position among a network of resistors. To convert from analog signals to digial signals, we need to encode the output voltage changing over time to some sequence of bits. We cannot interface analog electronics on digital devices such as (arduinos and raspberry pi w/o converting into digial signals).  What\u0026rsquo;s ADC? Let\u0026rsquo;s have an example of a 3-bit Analogue to Digital Converter :\nThis is how ADC works under the hood, steps of converting Analog to Digital  Analog voltage goes through Vin, Then it\u0026rsquo;s passed to a network of voltage comparators that compares its voltage to the selected reference range (Vref, which is selected at the time of wiring). If Vin \u0026gt; Vref the comparator output would be HIGH aka (1), if Vin \u0026lt; Vref the comparator output would be LOW aka (0). The significant of having a network of comparators is to encode the value of the analog signal into a digital sequence of bits. The output of comparators Dn gets passed into a 3-bit priority encoder. The priority encoder by definition, it encodes based on the high priority input and ignores the low priority input. So, if Vin = 3.5 to 4.0 V then the Comparators output = 11111111, At last when inputting the comparator output into the priority encoder the encoder gives a value of 7 which points to D7 of comparator U7 aka the last voltage level, and that\u0026rsquo;s true because our Vin is bigger than the Vref.  What\u0026rsquo;s SPI?  Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is an interface bus commonly used to send data between microcontrollers and small peripherals such as shift registers, sensors, and SD cards. It uses separate clock and data lines, along with a select line to choose the device you wish to talk to. Our target is to transfer the output from our priority encoder to the BCM processor of our Pi throughout the SPI protocol (Synchronously over Tx from MCP3008 to Rx of the Pi). To send and receive synchronous data we use MISO (the same as CIPO) for receving data from peripherals and MOSI (the same as COPI) to send data to the peripherals. MISO : Master-in-Slave-Out = CIPO : Controller-in-peripheral-out. MOSI : Master-out-Slave-In = COPI : Controller-out-Peripheral-in. MCP3008 is used to receive analog input, so MISO or CIPO is our common active data line. CS is the chip select, it\u0026rsquo;s used to select which peripheral device to use. SCLK is the serial clock and it\u0026rsquo;s used to synchronize data on a data line, to have a clear separate message per 8 clocks (8-bit message).  This diagram describes steps of how SPI Communication works in MCP3008 :\n CS = LOW -\u0026gt; signifies the selection to peripheral IO 0. SCLK += Clock. Rising edge of clock (LOW-to-HIGH) -\u0026raquo; Reads data from A/D and latches it for the MCU (micro-controller unit) -\u0026raquo; Creates the rising edges of Din line (Cyan line) -\u0026raquo; MOSI line. Falling edge of clock (HIGH-to_LOW) -\u0026raquo; Writes data from the MCU to the A/D -\u0026raquo; Creates the falling edges of Dout line bits (magneta line) -\u0026raquo; MISO line. Each input (D0, D1, D2, Dn) is an analog input that\u0026rsquo;s encoded into a 10-bit digital output (B0-B9) and then clocked out for the MCU on the falling edge of the SCLK as shown by the last data line (Dout). B-null (red circle) is the leading bit, it marks the last bit clocked out.  MCP3008 ADC  MCP3008 A/D Converter is a 10-bit analog to digital converter. 10-bit means : it has a maximum resolution of 10-bits in binary (1111111111) = in dec (1023) = in hex (3FF) and that\u0026rsquo;s determined by the Vref vs Dn voltage as discussed before using the voltage comparator. MCP3008 has 8 analog input channels that can be used in parallel (updated via SCLK using the SPI), the last number 8 stands for the number of analog inputs. MCP3008 controls its logic using SPI. MCP3008 can accept between 2v7 and 5v5 after which the IC may burn out. MCP3008 comes in various packages for various usages (PDIP, SOIC,\u0026hellip;.), in our case we would use the PDIP. Other adcs like MCP3002 and MCP3004 works by the same analogy, except that they can accept a max of 2 analog inputs and a max of 8 analog inputs respectively, if your project would use a max of 2 analog inputs, then you could buy MCP3002 and still can follow this tutorial.  Cracking the MCP3008 Datasheet Alright, here is how to tackle down the MCP3008/MCP3004 datasheet :\n  Know your package type whether PDIP (Plastic Dual in-Line), SOIC (Small Outline IC), TSSOP (Thin Shrink Small Outline Plastic) :\n  Know your pin configuration and orientation :\n In our case, we do a tutorial, so we will use PDIP (Plastic-Dual-In-Line) package :   So, our pins outline are as follows :    Know the meaning of pins on your package :\n  This is the hardest part of understanding how an IC work, but quick looking on an internal diagram may be insightful :\n  As you can see the MCP has a different way of comparing VREF and Din and encoding the results, it uses a modern way called 10-bit SAR - Successive Approximation Register and a DAC which we will not cover in this tutorial but the net result is the same as a using a network of resistors with comparators.\n  Know the max ratings of various IC properties before wiring up :\n VDD-Max-Rating = 5v5. VREF-Max-Raing = 5v5, min-working-voltage = 2v7. Analog-Channel-Max-Rating = VREF = 5v5 \u0026ndash; after that the channel may burn or the IC may not work. Max-Clock-Rating = f-CLK = 3.6 MHZ on 5v5, 1.35 MHZ on 2v7. Error = +/- 1.0 LSB (least significant bit). Resolution = max analog value = 10-bits = 0b1111111111 = 1023. Other data like CLK rising, falling and setup time are neglectable. You may pay attention to temperature data if your project works in a special temperature case like a hot place or freezer or etc.    Have some fun with the IC.\n  Wiring Up  Vcc : is used for powering up the IC and not to compare with VREF. Vref : is used for controlling the maximum resolution of the input voltage (analog signal), if VREF = 5v5 (maximum voltage received by MCP3008), then the resolution of Vin is a 100%.  Testing the wiring Before going deeper and testing with jme vehicle, please test this code and do your conclusions :\n// Define MCP3008 provider on CS0 -- Peripheral device 0 final MCP3008GpioProvider mcp3008GpioProvider = new MCP3008GpioProvider(SpiChannel.CS0); // define analog input pins on the adc final GpioPinAnalogInput[] gpioPinAnalogInput= new GpioPinAnalogInput[2]; gpioPinAnalogInput[0] = MCP3008Pin.CH0; gpioPinAnalogInput[1] = MCP3008Pin.CH1; // define the threshold analog (the minimum voltage at which the Pi can listen to). mcp3008GpioProvider.setEventThreshold(thresholdAnalogValue, gpioPinAnalogInput); // enable monitoring of analog values with an interval of 250 ms mcp3008GpioProvider.setMonitorEnabled(true); mcp3008GpioProvider.setMonitorInterval(250); // start collecting data from the SPi connected to MCP3008 output. final GpioController gpioController = GpioFactory.getInstance(); gpioController.addListener((GpioPinListenerAnalog) event -\u0026gt; { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Value at CH0 : \u0026#34; + mcp3008GpioProvider.getValue(gpioPinAnalogInput[0])); System.out.println(\u0026#34;Value at CH1 : \u0026#34; + mcp3008GpioProvider.getValue(gpioPinAnalogInput[1])); }, gpioPinAnalogInput); Testing with a jmonkeyengine vehicle It\u0026rsquo;s very hard to give you a full overview of how to create a jmonkeyengine vehicle in this tutorial, so you could fairly refer to jme docs and examples for more :\n Use the physics in your game and control your game via keyboard : https://wiki.jmonkeyengine.org/docs/3.4/tutorials/beginner/hello_physics.html A Keyboard controlled car demo : https://github.com/jMonkeyEngine/jmonkeyengine/blob/master/jme3-examples/src/main/java/jme3test/bullet/TestPhysicsCar.java The idea is simple, any game can be controlled using a keyboard interface (bound to jme update), so you can simply replace that with a custom InputHandler using a custom hardware.

In this post we focus on the Kiosk mode only.\nWith this approach, the application is the only thing you see on the screen. This prevents the user to open any other applications, or mess up your system. In this case, there is no need for a window manager, and the application directly uses the underlying (hardware) framebuffer. To achieve this, we use Monocle with EGL and DRM, as that is the Linux approach to directly address the hardware acceleration, without a window manager. The JavaFX application is using Direct Rendering Mode (DRM) to be visualized.

This page is only intended to give you a quick overview.\nExample applications HelloFX A simple application to test if the JavaFX libraries are installed correctly. Should not be used as a template for one\u0026rsquo;s own JavaFX applications.\nWiring The two other example applications use an LED and a button. These must be wired as is shown in the following diagram:\nMinimalPi4J The MinimalPi4j application is a Pi4j only application without a GUI. This application is also only used to test the setup and can be deleted after testing.\nPressing the button should generate a message in the console.\nOnce the Pi4J setup has been tested, MinimalPi4J can be deleted.\nTemplateApp This application shows the interaction between a JavaFX based Graphical User Interface (GUI) and the Raspberry Pi connected sensors and actuators, the Physical User Interface (PUI).\nThis application is to be used as a template for one\u0026rsquo;s own applications. This includes the existing test cases.\nYou should first get to know and understand the example. For your own applications you should then copy the the TemplateApp and modify it for your project, however without violating the rules of the MVC concept.\nTemplatePUIApp The MVC concept should also be used for applications without a GUI.\nWhen developing PUI only applications, or when adding the GUI later, then one should use the TemplatePUIApp as template.\nThe MVC concept The classic Model-View-Controller concept contains in addition to the starter class at least 3 more classes. The interaction is clearly defined:\nThis way the GUI and PUI are completely separated from each other, i.e a GUI button to turn an LED on has no direct access to the LED component of the PUI. Instead the GUI button triggers a corresponding action in the controller which then sets the on state property in the model. The PUI listening on this state then turns the actual LED on or off.\nGUI and PUI work with the same identical controller and thus also the same identical model.\nIn the MVC concept, every user interaction traverses the exact same cycle:\nConclusion You can use the same architecture (MVC) to implement a JavaFX-based GUI, a PUI attached to a Raspberry Pi, and integrate both in a clean, modular way.\n"},{"uri":"https://pi4j.com/documentation/build-io/","title":"Building an I/O Instance","tags":[],"description":"","content":"A GPIO can be configured like in the following example:\nvar ledConfig = DigitalOutput.newConfigBuilder(pi4j) .id(\u0026#34;my-dout\u0026#34;) .name(\u0026#34;My Digital Output\u0026#34;) .address(GPIO_PIN) .shutdown(DigitalState.LOW) .initial(DigitalState.HIGH) .provider(\u0026#34;linuxfs-digital-output\u0026#34;); newConfigBuilder parameters id The id field is used internally inside the Pi4J context/runtime to keep track of the instances.

As shown in the BMP280 usage a chip maybe available mounted on a small circuit board where connection to the Pi requires only jumpers. But even this simple means has limits as connecting several chips when using a Pi case and maybe a cooling fan creates problems. In addition some chips are only available as a socket device where a 4-28 pin socket is required. This next section demonstrates \u0026lsquo;a\u0026rsquo; way these limits can be overcome.\nConnecting to the Pi The use of breadboards adds flexibility in the ways to install and jumper to various chips. After soldering the pins to the chip breadboards you can use female-female jumpers to connect directly to the Pi Gpio pins from more than one chip breadboard.\nAlso, the jumper connections to the Pi are simplified by extending the Pi gpios to an external Gpio breadboard.\nPower off the Pi with sudo shutdown prior to making connections.\n Component and wiring Ribbon Cable Connecting directly to the Pi 40 pin connector becomes difficult as the number of terminations increase and the use of a case and fan require minor disassembly. The 40 pin connector can be extended to a Gpio breadboard. This extension is possible with a ribbon cable.\n    Ribbon cable and breadboards\n                               Once the ribbon cable is attached to the Pi 40 pin connector the Pi case can be secured.\n   Prototyope power\n    Ribbon cable termination Using a 40 pin connector labeled for a Pi facilitates installing jumpers.

Ever tried out Java 11+ support for running .java files directly in your shell but felt it was a bit too cumbersome ?\nJBang lets you do all this!\nVideo This video shows you all the steps described further on this page.\n  Prepare a Raspberry Pi For this manual you can use the following approach:\n Grab an SD card (minimum 8Gb) Use the Raspberry Pi Imager tool to write the \u0026ldquo;Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit)\u0026rdquo; to this SD card Push the SD card into your Raspberry Pi board Power up and wait until the OS has booted (it will probably restart once to resize the partition on the SD card to the maximum available size) Open a terminal and confirm Java is not available yet (except if you selected the \u0026ldquo;Raspberry Pi OS Full (32-bit)\u0026rdquo; version)  $ java -version bash: java: command not found Installing JBang As described on jbang.dev/download installing JBang is enough to get started, even if you don\u0026rsquo;t have Java installed already, as JBang will also take care of this.\n$ curl -Ls https://sh.jbang.dev | bash -s - app setup $ java -version openjdk version \u0026#34;11.0.14\u0026#34; 2022-01-18 OpenJDK Runtime Environment Temurin-11.0.14+9 (build 11.0.14+9) OpenJDK Server VM Temurin-11.0.14+9 (build 11.0.14+9, mixed mode) Minimal JBang example A minimal JBang Java-file looks like the following code block, take note of the special first line that tricks the system to run this as a script while still being valid Java-code.\n///usr/bin/env jbang \u0026#34;$0\u0026#34; \u0026#34;$@\u0026#34; ; exit $?  class HelloWorld { public static void main(String[] args) { if(args.length==0) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Hello World!\u0026#34;); } else { System.out.println(\u0026#34;Hello \u0026#34; + args[0]); } } } By saving this file as HelloWorld.java it can be started with:\n$ jbang HelloWorld.java Hello World! JBang Pi4J example If your project needs dependencies - which is the case for a Pi4J project - you can define them in the java-file with the following gradle-style locators format, for example: //DEPS com.pi4j:pi4j-core:2.1.1.\nThe following example is based on the \u0026ldquo;Minimal example application\u0026rdquo;, and uses the same wiring with a button and LED.

The ADS1115 device is a precision, low-power, 16-bit, I2C-compatible, analog-to-digital converter (ADCs). The ADS1115 device incorporates a low-drift voltage reference and an oscillator as well as a programmable gain amplifier (PGA) and a digital comparator. These features, along with a wide operating supply range, makes the ADS1115 well suited for power- and space-constrained, sensor measurement applications.\nThe ADS1115 performs conversions at data rates up to 860 samples per second (SPS). The PGA offers input ranges from ±256 mV to ±6.144 V, allowing precise large- and small-signal measurements. The ADS1115 features an input multiplexer (MUX) that allows two differential or four single-ended input measurements. Use the digital comparator for under- and overvoltage detection.\nThe ADS1115 operates in either continuous-conversion mode or single-shot mode.

Any commercially available potentiometer with three connections (fixed resistor and the slider) can be evaluated with this class.\nThe current position of the slider can be defined with a single shot. The return value is either in volts or as a normalized value between 0 and 1.\nFor continuous monitoring either a slow method can be selected or a fast one. In this case, individual measurements (single shots) are started and evaluated cyclically. With this method, up to 4 devices can be attached to the AD converter. The maximum sampling frequency of the signal depends on how many channels of the AD converter are used simultaneously and how high the sampling rate of the AD converter is set to.\nUsing the fast method, a continuous measurement is started in the AD converter. The maximum sampling frequency is now only dependent on the sampling rate of the AD converter.

The abbreviation PWM stands for \u0026ldquo;Pulse Width Modulation\u0026rdquo; and is also often referred to in German as pulse width modulation or pulse width modulation. This technology is used, among other things, to control servomotors and is also used, for example, for the fans of a regular computer.\nWith PWM, it is possible to control a component such as a motor no longer purely binary, i.e. off (0% power) or on (100% power), but to control them almost at will. The functionality of PWM works in such a way that the component is switched off and on again and again within a certain period of time.\nSoftware vs. Hardware Two different types of PWM are available on the Raspberry Pi, specifically a software and a hardware implementation. Both basically offer the same options, but the software version cannot achieve precise or particularly fast frequencies.\nThe reason for this is that in the software implementation for each individual cycle (on / off) a new control command must be transmitted from the JVM (Java Virtual Machine) to the corresponding component, while in the hardware implementation of the Raspberry Pi notices the desired frequency and regulates it independently directly on the board.\nThe Raspberry Pi supports 2 hardware based PWM channels. You can access these two channels via 2 separate sets of 4 GPIO header pins, but still limited to only 2 channels (2 unique PWM timing configurations).\nThe same PWM channel is available on multiple GPIO. The latest frequency and dutycycle setting will be used by all GPIO which share a PWM channel. The GPIO must be one of the following: 12 PWM channel 0 All models but A and B 13 PWM channel 1 All models but A and B 18 PWM channel 0 All models 19 PWM channel 1 All models but A and B 40 PWM channel 0 Compute module only 41 PWM channel 1 Compute module only 45 PWM channel 1 Compute module only 52 PWM channel 0 Compute module only 53 PWM channel 1 Compute module only As Pi4J is using PiGPIO \u0026ldquo;under the hood\u0026rdquo;, you can take advantage of the additional PWM functionalities of it. PiGPIO is providing additional (soft) PWM support to any of the GPIO pins (0-31) and its using some hardware timing technique to optimize performance \u0026mdash; but its not the same as the actual hardware PWM pins natively on the RaspberryPi. In the Pi4J API, we call this \u0026ldquo;Software\u0026rdquo; PWM and you would need to set .pwmType(PwmType.SOFTWARE). We consider this software-based PWM because its being provided at a software layer, in this case by the PIGPIO library.\nIf you need more than 2 PWM pins, use the software PWM functionality, it may be perfectly fine for your application. If they are not good enough, then you will probably need a PWM expander board/chip (controlled by I2C/SPI) to provide additional PWM support.\nTechnical implementation For the technical control of a component with PWM, two values must be defined:\n Pulse-pause ratio (English: Duty Cycle): This value defines the ratio between the switched-on and switched-off status and is represented by a number between 0% and 100%. A value of 50% means that within one cycle the component is switched on exactly half the time and then switched off. A value of 25%, on the other hand, would mean that the component is switched on only a quarter of the time and the component remains switched off for the remaining three quarters of the cycle. Frequency: This value defines how often per second a cycle (on / off) takes place for this component and is usually specified in the unit Hertz (Hz). With a value of 10Hz, the component would alternate 10 times between being switched on and switched off in one second.  These two values can be controlled via the Pi4J library and are also used internally by this project.\nAdditional Information  Wikipedia on PWM Wikipedia with audio frequencies  Code example The following example is an extract of the CrowPi example project which includes a component to control a buzzer with PWM.\npublic class BuzzerComponent extends Component { protected final Pwm pwm; /** * Creates a new buzzer component with a custom BCM pin. * * @param pi4j Pi4J context * @param address Custom BCM pin address */ public BuzzerComponent(Context pi4j, int address) { this.pwm = pi4j.create(buildPwmConfig(pi4j, address)); } /** * Plays a tone with the given frequency in Hz indefinitely. * This method is non-blocking and returns immediately. * A frequency of zero causes the buzzer to play silence. * * @param frequency Frequency in Hz */ public void playTone(int frequency) { playTone(frequency, 0); } /** * Plays a tone with the given frequency in Hz for a specific duration. * This method is blocking and will sleep until the specified duration has passed. * A frequency of zero causes the buzzer to play silence. * A duration of zero to play the tone indefinitely and return immediately. * * @param frequency Frequency in Hz * @param duration Duration in milliseconds */ public void playTone(int frequency, int duration) { if (frequency \u0026gt; 0) { // Activate the PWM with a duty cycle of 50% and the given frequency in Hz.  // This causes the buzzer to be on for half of the time during each cycle, resulting in the desired frequency.  pwm.on(50, frequency); // If the duration is larger than zero, the tone should be automatically stopped after the given duration.  if (duration \u0026gt; 0) { sleep(duration); this.playSilence(); } } else { this.playSilence(duration); } } /** * Silences the buzzer and returns immediately. */ public void playSilence() { pwm.off(); } /** * Silences the buzzer and waits for the given duration. * This method is blocking and will sleep until the specified duration has passed. * * @param duration Duration in milliseconds */ public void playSilence(int duration) { this.playSilence(); sleep(duration); } /** * Returns the created PWM instance for the buzzer * * @return PWM instance */ protected Pwm getPwm() { return this.pwm; } /** * Builds a new PWM configuration for the buzzer * * @param pi4j Pi4J context * @param address BCM pin address * @return PWM configuration */ protected static PwmConfig buildPwmConfig(Context pi4j, int address) { return Pwm.newConfigBuilder(pi4j) .id(\u0026#34;BCM\u0026#34; + address) .name(\u0026#34;Buzzer\u0026#34;) .address(address) .pwmType(PwmType.HARDWARE) .provider(\u0026#34;pigpio-pwm\u0026#34;) .initial(0) .shutdown(0) .build(); } } "},{"uri":"https://pi4j.com/documentation/io-examples/i2c/","title":"Inter-Integrated Circuit (I²C)","tags":["I2C"],"description":"","content":"What is it? I²C (spoken as I-Squared-C) is a bus originally invented by Philips. It is designed as a classic master-slave bus. A data transfer is always i nitiated by a master. It can also be set up in a multi-master system. I²C is connected via two signal lines (data line and clock line). The transmission rate of the bus can be between 0.1 Mbit/s up to 3.4 Mbit/s depending on the clock rate. If only a unidirectional connection is required, even 5.0 Mbit/s would be possible. It should be noted: the higher the clock rate, the more susceptible to failure the overall system becomes. The low operating voltage of only 3.3V does not contribute to interference resistance either.\nUses I²C is mainly used for communication between microcontrollers. The advantage that a whole series of microcontrollers can be controlled via just 2 lines is of course very interesting for the circuit board layout. The main advantages of I²C are its simplicity. There are certainly newer bus systems with better transmission rates. Hardly any bus system is as easy to use as I²C. Even “hot plugging”, ie plugging in and unplugging the devices during operation, is possible with I²C.\nAddressing I²C uses an address space of 7 bits. This allows up to 112 nodes on one bus. The remaining 16 addresses are reserved for special applications. Usually the address of a device is defined directly by the manufacturer. It can therefore be found in the relevant data sheets. Due to the shortage of addresses, there is also a variant with a 10-bit address space. Up to 1136 nodes are possible, and the protocol is compatible with the smaller 7-bit address space.\nTransfer rates    Mode Max. transfer rate Direction     Standard Mode 0.1 Mbit/s bidirektional   Fast Mode 0.4 Mbit/s bidirektional   Fast Mode Plus 1.0 Mbit/s bidirektional   High Speed Mode 3.4 Mbit/s bidirektional   Ultra Fast-mode 5.0 Mbit/s unidirektional    Additional information  Wikipedia I²C I²C Bus  Code example The following code shows setting the pins on a TCA 9534 which can be found on \u0026ldquo;Sequent Microsystems\u0026rdquo;\nTo use the LinuxFS provider, which provides I2C, add the proper dependency:\n\u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;com.pi4j\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;pi4j-plugin-linuxfs\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;version\u0026gt;${pi4j.version}\u0026lt;/version\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; Now we can use the following example:\nimport com.pi4j.Pi4J; import com.pi4j.context.Context; import com.pi4j.io.i2c.I2C; import com.pi4j.io.i2c.I2CConfig; import com.pi4j.io.i2c.I2CProvider; public class SimpleTca9534I2cTest { private static final byte TCA9534_REG_ADDR_OUT_PORT = 0x01; private static final byte TCA9534_REG_ADDR_CFG = 0x03; public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { Context pi4j = Pi4J.newAutoContext(); I2CProvider i2CProvider = pi4j.provider(\u0026#34;linuxfs-i2c\u0026#34;); I2CConfig i2cConfig = I2C.newConfigBuilder(pi4j).id(\u0026#34;TCA9534\u0026#34;).bus(1).device(0x3f).build(); try (I2C tca9534Dev = i2CProvider.create(i2cConfig)) { int config = tca9534Dev.readRegister(TCA9534_REG_ADDR_CFG); if (config \u0026lt; 0) throw new IllegalStateException( \u0026#34;Failed to read configuration from address 0x\u0026#34; + String.format(\u0026#34;%02x\u0026#34;, TCA9534_REG_ADDR_CFG)); byte currentState = (byte) tca9534Dev.readRegister(TCA9534_REG_ADDR_OUT_PORT); if (config != 0x00) { System.out.println(\u0026#34;TCA9534 is not configured as OUTPUT, setting register 0x\u0026#34; + String .format(\u0026#34;%02x\u0026#34;, TCA9534_REG_ADDR_CFG) + \u0026#34; to 0x00\u0026#34;); currentState = 0x00; tca9534Dev.writeRegister(TCA9534_REG_ADDR_OUT_PORT, currentState); tca9534Dev.writeRegister(TCA9534_REG_ADDR_CFG, (byte) 0x00); } // bit 8, is pin 1 on the board itself, so set pins in reverse: \tcurrentState = setPin(currentState, 8, tca9534Dev, true); Thread.sleep(500L); currentState = setPin(currentState, 8, tca9534Dev, false); Thread.sleep(500L); currentState = setPin(currentState, 7, tca9534Dev, true); Thread.sleep(500L); currentState = setPin(currentState, 7, tca9534Dev, false); Thread.sleep(500L); } } public static byte setPin(byte currentState, int pin, I2C tca9534Dev, boolean high) { byte newState; if (high) newState = (byte) (currentState | (1 \u0026lt;\u0026lt; pin)); else newState = (byte) (currentState \u0026amp; ~(1 \u0026lt;\u0026lt; pin)); System.out.println(\u0026#34;Setting TCA9534 to new state \u0026#34; + asBinary(newState)); tca9534Dev.writeRegister(TCA9534_REG_ADDR_OUT_PORT, newState); return newState; } public static String asBinary(byte b) { StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(); sb.append(((b \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; 7) \u0026amp; 1)); sb.append(((b \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; 6) \u0026amp; 1)); sb.append(((b \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; 5) \u0026amp; 1)); sb.append(((b \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; 4) \u0026amp; 1)); sb.append(((b \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; 3) \u0026amp; 1)); sb.append(((b \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; 2) \u0026amp; 1)); sb.append(((b \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; 1) \u0026amp; 1)); sb.append(((b \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; 0) \u0026amp; 1)); return sb.toString(); } } "},{"uri":"https://pi4j.com/documentation/io-examples/i2c/clock-stretching/","title":"I²C Clock Stretching","tags":["I2C"],"description":"","content":"Clock Stretching Please be aware there are some hardware issues when using the Raspberry Pi with devices that expect to be able to use clock stretching, for more info see \u0026ldquo;Adventures in I2C: clock stretching on the Raspberry Pi\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;I2C stretch bug.

The Serial Peripheral Interface, abbreviated to SPI, is a bus system which enables communication between a main device (called “master”) and one or more secondary devices (called “slave”). A direct communication between all participants is not possible here, much more the master can choose at any time with which slave he would like to exchange data.\nIn order to address only one slave, a total of 3 signal lines are required, two of which are used for bidirectional data transmission and one as a clock generator for serial transmission. If further slaves are to be addressed, additional signal lines are required depending on the desired topology.\nUses In addition to communication between microcontrollers, SPI is also used to address numerous sensors and actuators. Similar to I²C, a large number of control commands and data can be transmitted in both directions with a relatively high clock rate over 3 lines. A particular advantage here is the support for “full duplex”, ie the simultaneous transmission of data in both directions.\nThe technical implementation is very simple and is also used, for example, to communicate with SD cards. The Nintendo Game Boy already used this protocol to connect several game consoles via the Game Boy Link Cable.\nAddressing As already mentioned in the first section, multiple slaves can also be connected to SPI. The number available depends on the hardware used. On the Raspberry Pi, the standard SPI0 with two different slaves use what is called Chip Select Pins is controlled.\nAdditional Information  Wikipedia SPI SPI pinout for Raspberry Pi  Code example Initialize the Pi4J Context with a provider which supports SPI fully, e.g. the PiGpioSpiProvider.

Serial communication can be used to transfer data between different boards, devices, etc. Data is transfered bit-by-bit in a sequence, through a single wire from a transmitter (= TX) to a receiver (= RX). On the receiver side the bits are combined to bytes.\nWhen you need two-way communication, two wires are needed between RX and TX from both sides:\nThe communication between these two devices can happen in different ways:\n simplex: one direction only without a message back to confirm the receiving half-duplex: devices can only send or receive at once full-duplex: both devices can send and receive at the same time  Serial communication is done at a predefined speed which needs to be known on both sides, as both the sender and receiver need to handle the data at the same speed. This speed is called the \u0026ldquo;baud rate\u0026rdquo; with a value indicating the number of bits per second (bps). The most used speed is 9600 bps, but you can use lower (1200, 2400, 4800) or higher (19200, 38400, 57600, 115200) speeds, depending on the speed which can be handled reliably by the device.\nThe Pi has two built-in connections to GPIOs BCM number 14 (TX) and 15 (RX). Identical to the other GPIOs, they use 3.3V so make sure, when you connect other devices, the same voltage is used.\nCode example The following example demonstrates how you can connect to a GPS module to read the data. This example is based on an example from the book \u0026ldquo;The Definitive Guide to Modern Java Clients with JavaFX\u0026rdquo; by Stephen Chin, Johan Vos and James Weaver. That example uses V1 of Pi4J with a listener provided by the library. In V.2 this listener is no longer provided but can easily be achieved with a Thread to handle the incoming data.\nWiring The GPS module used in this example: NEO-7M.\n   NEO-7M Raspberry Pi     VCC Power 5V (e.g. pin 2)   GND Ground (e.g. pin 6)   RX UART TX, GPIO 15   TX UART RX, GPIO 16    In the readme of the coding example, you can find the description how you can test the GPS module in the terminal with gpsd.socket.\nInitialize the serial port First Pi4J needs to be initialized. Within this context we can then configure and open the serial port. As long as the serial port is open, we run a thread to handle the incoming data.\nvar console = new Console(); var pi4j = Pi4J.newAutoContext(); var serial = pi4j.create(Serial.newConfigBuilder(pi4j) .use_9600_N81() .dataBits_8() .parity(Parity.NONE) .stopBits(StopBits._1) .flowControl(FlowControl.NONE) .id(\u0026#34;my-serial\u0026#34;) .device(SERIAL_ADDRESS) .provider(\u0026#34;pigpio-serial\u0026#34;) .build()); serial.open(); // Wait till the serial port is open console.print(\u0026#34;Waiting till serial port is open\u0026#34;); while (!serial.isOpen()) { Thread.sleep(250); } // Start a thread to handle the incoming data from the serial port SerialReader serialReader = new SerialReader(console, serial); Thread serialReaderThread = new Thread(serialReader, \u0026#34;SerialReader\u0026#34;); serialReaderThread.setDaemon(true); serialReaderThread.start(); while (serial.isOpen()) { Thread.sleep(500); } serialReader.stopReading(); Serial reader The reader itself implements a Runnable and waits till data is available from the serial port. As the GPS module sends its data as readable String lines seperated by a line separator, we only need to handle the bytes which are higher than 32 (see the ASCII code table). All lower values are handled as line separators.\npublic class SerialReader implements Runnable { private final Console console; private final Serial serial; private boolean continueReading = true; public SerialReader(Console console, Serial serial) { this.console = console; this.serial = serial; } public void stopReading() { continueReading = false; } @Override public void run() { // We use a buffered reader to handle the data received from the serial port  BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(serial.getInputStream())); try { // Data from the GPS is recieved in lines  String line = \u0026#34;\u0026#34;; // Read data until the flag is false  while (continueReading) { // First we need to check if there is data available to read.  // The read() command for pigio-serial is a NON-BLOCKING call,  // in contrast to typical java input streams.  var available = serial.available(); if (available \u0026gt; 0) { for (int i = 0; i \u0026lt; available; i++) { byte b = (byte) br.read(); if (b \u0026lt; 32) { // All non-string bytes are handled as line breaks  if (!line.isEmpty()) { // Here we should add code to parse the data to a GPS data object  console.println(\u0026#34;Data: \u0026#39;\u0026#34; + line + \u0026#34;\u0026#39;\u0026#34;); line = \u0026#34;\u0026#34;; } } else { line += (char) b; } } } else { Thread.sleep(10); } } } catch (Exception e) { console.println(\u0026#34;Error reading data from serial: \u0026#34; + e.getMessage()); System.out.println(e.getStackTrace()); } } } Running the application on Raspberry Pi You can get the full working example from GitHub and run on a Raspberry Pi after you correctly connected a GPS module.

By default Pi4J embeds these native libraries as resources inside the plugin\u0026rsquo;s JAR file. At runtime Pi4J extracts the native library into a temporary directory so the JVM can load the library from the filesystem. Upon termination the temporary file is automatically removed.\nThis automatic extration behavior works well for most users; however, there are certain edge cases where this may fail. On failure, its common to see a UnsatisfiedLinkError on startup of your application or when you create a Pi4J context. Edge cases such as the following may require customization of the runtime to deal with native library loading.\n Systems that do not support a writable temporary directory (/tmp) may encounter the UnsatisfiedLinkError and fail to load the native library. Systems with very strict security policies may encounter the UnsatisfiedLinkError and fail to load the native library if unable to extract the resource from the JAR at runtime. Users attempting to use Pi4J under Android may also experience the UnsatisfiedLinkError and fail to load the native library.   Explicitly Define the Library Path In the event of a failure to extract and load the embedded native library from the JAR file at runtime, a user can override this default behavior by defining the system property: pi4j.library.path.\nUsage: pi4j.library.path=(system|/some/directory) Values:    Property Value Description     system The default system defined library path for the JVM (java.library.path) will be used to resolve the native libraries.   local Native libraries will be resolved in the same local directory as the plugin JAR file on the file system.   absolute file path(/some/directory) This user defined library path (absolute filesystem path) will be used to resolve the native libraries.    Examples: The pi4j.library.path system property can be assigned in the command line used to launch your Java application using the -D flag.\njava --Dpi4j.library.path=\u0026quot;system\u0026quot; ... -or- java --Dpi4j.library.path=\u0026quot;local\u0026quot; ... -or- java --Dpi4j.library.path=\u0026quot;/some/directory\u0026quot; ... The pi4j.library.path system property can be assigned in your code at startup and prior to creating a Pi4J Context.\nSystem.setProperty(\u0026quot;pi4j.library.path\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;/some/directory\u0026quot;); -or- System.setProperty(\u0026quot;pi4j.library.path\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;system\u0026quot;); -or- System.setProperty(\u0026quot;pi4j.library.path\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;local\u0026quot;);  For more details about the native library loading behavior, please see the NativeLibraryLoader.java class: https://github.com/Pi4J/pi4j-v2/blob/master/libraries/pi4j-library-pigpio/src/main/java/com/pi4j/library/pigpio/util/NativeLibraryLoader.java\n  Where To Get The Native Libraries The Pi4J native libraries can be obtained by extracting the architecture specific libpi4j-xxx.so file from the plugin JAR file\u0026rsquo;s resources.\nAdditionally, the Pi4J native libraries are published as independant artifacts in the Maven Repository: https://oss.sonatype.org/#nexus-search;quick~pi4j-library-pigpio\n"},{"uri":"https://pi4j.com/documentation/providers/pigpio/","title":"PiGpio","tags":[],"description":"","content":"The current implementation of the PiGpio exposes the GPIO functions available on the Raspberry Pi.\nProviders in the PiGpio plugin:\n pigpio-digital-input pigpio-digital-output pigpio-pwm pigpio-i2c pigpio-spi pigpio-serial  To use the PiGpio provider include the following dependencies:\n\u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;com.pi4j\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;pi4j-core\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;version\u0026gt;${pi4j.version}\u0026lt;/version\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;com.pi4j\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;pi4j-plugin-raspberrypi\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;version\u0026gt;${pi4j.version}\u0026lt;/version\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;dependency\u0026gt; \u0026lt;groupId\u0026gt;com.pi4j\u0026lt;/groupId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;artifactId\u0026gt;pi4j-plugin-pigpio\u0026lt;/artifactId\u0026gt; \u0026lt;version\u0026gt;${pi4j.version}\u0026lt;/version\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/dependency\u0026gt; "},{"uri":"https://pi4j.com/architecture/advanced/plugins/","title":"Plug-ins","tags":[],"description":"","content":"The goal of Pi4J V.2 is to provide a solid base with all required \u0026ldquo;minimal functionality\u0026rdquo; while at the same time, promote third-party development and extensibility, thus enabling developers to build and maintain their extensions outside of the Pi4J core projects codebase.\nThis will enable us to deliver a stable, fully tested framework as the number of features inside of Pi4J can be limited and support for specific I/O hardware can be provided with an extension for Pi4J.\nMore info about how this extensibility is achieved:\n Extensible I/O hardware PROVIDERS: things like GPIO expanders, I2C bus expanders, GertBoard, add-on hardware shields, etc. Extensible SBC platforms PLATFORMS: the core project may only support Raspberry Pi, but the platform and libraries should be written to allow a third party to create plugins for alternate hardware platforms/boards.

This project abstracts the low-level native integration and interrupt monitoring to enable Java programmers to focus on implementing their application business logic.\nBrief History The Pi4J Project was started in 2012, the same year the Raspberry Pi was introduced as a tool to provide Java developers a simple and familiar object-oriented interface library to access the low-level I/O capabilities of the Raspberry Pi including GPIO, I2C, SPI, PWM and Serial communications.\nProject Mission/Goals The Pi4J Project\u0026rsquo;s mission is to provide a rich and powerful, yet simple to use, Java-friendly API library enabling programmatic access to the low-level hardware I/O capabilities of embedded platforms such as the Raspberry Pi.\nProject Status Summary The Pi4j project has evolved in all these years as the whole Java eco-system and Raspberry Pi systems have been evolving.\nThis resulted in two main versions.\nVersion 1 The original library which started in 2012 and got a last release in 2021. Up till version 1.3 the library targets Java 8, while version 1.4 relies on Java 11. More info is provided on \u0026ldquo;Previous versions (V.1)\u0026quot;.\nVersion 2 As of Version 2.0, Pi4J will no longer include support for peripheral devices and add-on chipsets/boards as part of the core project. A new plugin model has been introduced in version 2.0 that should help enable third-party development and support third-party add-ons which may be developed and maintained independently of the core Pi4J project.\nRead more on \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s New (V.2)\u0026quot;.\n"}]
