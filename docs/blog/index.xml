Yes, the Raspberry Pi Operating System is awesome! But the Pi4J project made it if even more awesome by adding &amp;ldquo;goodies&amp;rdquo; for Java developers! Pi4J OS is not yet another OS, but the official Raspberry Pi OS, with additional tools and preconfigurations to make it the ideal OS for any Java and JavaFX developer who wants to use a Raspberry Pi.
The project is shared on GitHub and documented on the Pi4J website.</description></item><item><title>LED strip with Pi4J and JBang</title><link>https://pi4j.com/blog/2022/20221128_led_strip_with_jbang/</link><pubDate>Mon, 28 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/blog/2022/20221128_led_strip_with_jbang/</guid><description>2022-11-28, by Robert von Burg
Intro In an earlier post, JBang and Pi4J were used to control a LED and button connected to a Raspberry Pi.
This week Robert von Burg, one of the main contributors of the Pi4J project, shared on Mastodon another project where a LED strip is controlled via I2C.
This is the result, notice the Foojay.io startup artwork ðŸ˜‰
Wiring The Raspberry Pi in the video is attached to a custom PCB used by Robert in medical cabinets.</description></item><item><title>Kotlin on the Raspberry Pi</title><link>https://pi4j.com/blog/2022/20221117_kotlin_on_raspberrypi/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/blog/2022/20221117_kotlin_on_raspberrypi/</guid><description>2022-11-17, by Muhammad Hashim
Intro Pi4J is considered the project that brought the JVM to the RaspberryPi.
It has been up for more than a decade allowing developers to write sophisticated, high-level, yet simple software on the RaspberryPi.
And weâ€™re glad to make it even more simpler and powerful!
For quite some years now Kotlin has been a most welcome language in the JVM ecosystem and the modern development toolchain.</description></item><item><title>Getting Started Template</title><link>https://pi4j.com/blog/2022/20220113_javafx_pi4j_template/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/blog/2022/20220113_javafx_pi4j_template/</guid><description>2022-01-13, by Frank Delporte
Intro The Pi4J project wants to be the starting point for everyone who wants to use Java on the Raspberry Pi, being it a headless, JavaFX-user interface and/or GPIO-controller project.
Pi4J is intended to provide a friendly object-oriented I/O API and implementation libraries for Java Programmers to access the full I/O capabilities of the Raspberry Pi platform. This project abstracts the low-level native integration and interrupt monitoring to enable Java programmers to focus on implementing their application business logic.</description></item></channel></rss>
