Next to the declarative approach, Java annotations are available for the configuration of I/O provisioning instead of the hard-coded approach offered in V.1.
This implementation still needs to be further fine-tuned and unified somehow to make things cleaner and more straightforward, but would provide a way to initialize a I/O for instance like this:</description></item><item><title>Dependency injection</title><link>https://pi4j.com/architecture/advanced/dependency-injection/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/architecture/advanced/dependency-injection/</guid><description>To simplify the initial V.2 version, the DI implementation has be removed so it could be refactored and extended later.

Along with the annotated I/O configuration the ability to support I/O provisioning via dependency injection also makes a lot of sense. There is some basic brute-force stuff working but this needs more work to make this a compatible implementation for Spring or CDI.</description></item><item><title>Native Library Path</title><link>https://pi4j.com/architecture/advanced/library-path/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/architecture/advanced/library-path/</guid><description>Overview Some Pi4J plugins, such as the Pi4J PiGpio Provider plugin, depend on native JNI libraries to communicate with the underlying system. By default Pi4J embeds these native libraries as resources inside the plugin&amp;rsquo;s JAR file. At runtime Pi4J extracts the native library into a temporary directory so the JVM can load the library from the filesystem. Upon termination the temporary file is automatically removed.
This automatic extration behavior works well for most users; however, there are certain edge cases where this may fail.</description></item><item><title>Plug-ins</title><link>https://pi4j.com/architecture/advanced/plugins/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/architecture/advanced/plugins/</guid><description>The goal of Pi4J V.2 is to provide a solid base with all required &amp;ldquo;minimal functionality&amp;rdquo; while at the same time, promote third-party development and extensibility, thus enabling developers to build and maintain their extensions outside of the Pi4J core projects codebase.
This will enable us to deliver a stable, fully tested framework as the number of features inside of Pi4J can be limited and support for specific I/O hardware can be provided with an extension for Pi4J.</description></item><item><title>Remote support</title><link>https://pi4j.com/architecture/advanced/remote-support/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/architecture/advanced/remote-support/</guid><description>One of the big features on the wish-list for V.2: native support for remote I/O capability. Predominantly to support the ability for a user to perform development work on their desktop/laptop and be able to run their project with remote support slaving the I/O to a daemon running on the Raspberry Pi (or other supported SBC).
TO BE DECIDED: the V.2 codebase does support this currently by using the PiGpio daemon.</description></item></channel></rss>
