This implementation is developed/supported by a team separate of Pi4j. Pi4j is a consumer of that PiGpio work.
Pi5 At the present time the PiGpio implementation does not support the new Pi5 board. - This new Pi5 RP1 chip will require a large development effort. There is no known plan for this develoment.</description></item><item><title>Serial (UART/RS232)</title><link>https://pi4j.com/documentation/io-examples/serial/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/documentation/io-examples/serial/</guid><description>GITHUB PROJECT: https://github.com/Pi4J/pi4j-example-components/blob/main/src/main/java/com/pi4j/catalog/applications/SerialGps_App.java
What is it? Serial communication can be used to transfer data between different boards, devices, etc. Data is transfered bit-by-bit in a sequence, through a single wire from a transmitter (= TX) to a receiver (= RX). On the receiver side the bits are combined to bytes.
When you need two-way communication, two wires are needed between RX and TX from both sides:
The communication between these two devices can happen in different ways:</description></item></channel></rss>
