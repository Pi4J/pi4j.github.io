The template is created for a digital joystick with 4 directions (up, right, down, left) and as an option additionally with a push button in direction down. A suitable hardware component is the arcade joystick in the picture bellow. But any joystick with switching contacts will meet the requirements.
The template class allows to query the individual joystick positions and can trigger a simple event when the joystick swings out in a direction or when it returns to the center position.</description></item></channel></rss>
