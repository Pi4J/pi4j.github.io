This project by Tom Aarts (published on May 15, 2024), is a binary clock created with LEDs on a breadboard. In the video below you see it incrementing to the next minute and hour. What you see is the Hour Minute and Second displayed in BCD (Binary Coded Decimal):
Design document describing the LED PCF8575 connections, and the Java implementation that drives the clock LEDs. Note: there are two PCF8575 IC used in this design.</description></item><item><title>Community Implementations</title><link>https://pi4j.com/examples/communityimplementation/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/examples/communityimplementation/</guid><description>On this page we want to keep a list of projects which contain implementation code for specific devices using the Pi4J V.2 core library. Please let us know via Pi4J V.2 Discussions if you want to have your project added to this list.
