The providers also allow to separate the internal logic of the Pi4J core from the concrete implementation of the board on which they are used.
Pi4J 2.0 - 2.4: Multiple providers for the same I/O type can be loaded into a Pi4J context concurrently. For example a &amp;ldquo;RaspberryPi-DigitalInputProvider&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;GertBoard-DigitalInputProvider&amp;rdquo; could both be loaded and both providing digital inputs at the same time.</description></item><item><title>LinuxFS Provider</title><link>https://pi4j.com/documentation/providers/linuxfs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/documentation/providers/linuxfs/</guid><description>The current implementation of the LinuxFS plugin implements a file based I2C and PWM provider. The file based I2C provider opens /dev/i2c-1 using a RandomAccessFile to perform I2C reads and writes. The file based PWM provider opens /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip? using a RandomAccessFile to perform PWM operations.
The Linuxfs provider linuxfs-pwm requires minimum kernel Bullseye 6.1.21 and Bookworm 6.6.22 !
Providers in the LinuxFS plugin:
linuxfs-i2c linuxfs-pwm Under construction linuxfs-digital-input linuxfs-digital-output To use the LinuxFS provider include the following dependencies:</description></item><item><title>PWM Hardware Support on RPi5</title><link>https://pi4j.com/blog/2024/20240423_pwm_rpi5/</link><pubDate>Tue, 23 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/blog/2024/20240423_pwm_rpi5/</guid><description>2024-04-23, by Tom Aarts
The next version of Pi4J (are now already in 2.5.2-SNAPSHOT) will add PWM support via a new provider linuxfs-pwm. The previous PWM PiGpio provider does not support the Raspberry Pi 5 RP1 chip. To use this new provider, changes are required in your pom.xml dependencies and Java code. The details of using this new provider are explained in the Pi4J documentation in Pulse Width Modulation. In this blog post, I want to provide extra details and an example implementation.</description></item></channel></rss>
