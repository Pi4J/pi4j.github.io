The &amp;ldquo;Minimal example application&amp;rdquo; uses one LED and button to demonstrate the basic use of Pi4J V.2. When building that project with Maven, all the required Java modules are copied to the target/distribution directory. But a lot of developers like to produce a single, executable JAR that contains all dependencies, also known as a &amp;ldquo;FAT JAR&amp;rdquo;.
The repository &amp;ldquo;pi4j-example-fatjar&amp;rdquo; GitHub project contains a Maven project with identical wiring, dependencies and build command to the &amp;ldquo;Minimal example application&amp;rdquo;, but results in such a FAT JAR instead of separate Java modules.</description></item><item><title>Build as a FAT JAR with Maven</title><link>https://pi4j.com/documentation/building/fat-jar/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/documentation/building/fat-jar/</guid><description>EXAMPLE PROJECT: https://github.com/Pi4J/pi4j-example-fatjar
About FAT JARs With Pi4J V1 you can create a so-called FAT JAR, which packages all the dependencies into one jar-file. That way it is very easy to build your project on one computer and distribute your application as a single file to one or more clients.
Because of the modular approach and how Pi4J V.2 loads it dependencies at runtime, this approach can be achieved by using the maven-shade-plugin.</description></item></channel></rss>
