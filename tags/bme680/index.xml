Bosch has several sensors which are extremely small to measure temperature, humidity, pressure, and gas. We also have several example implementations documented on the Pi4J website:
BME280 Sensor (temp, humidity, pressure) via Pi4J, I2C, and JBang. BMP280 Sensor, example implementation by Thomas Aarts. LED Matrix with SPI MAX7219, work-in-progress for a weather station. Sensor drivers, project by Juraj Veverka. You can find easy-to-use boards with such a sensor, for instance, on:</description></item></channel></rss>
