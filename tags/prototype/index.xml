&lt;p>Experimenting with various ICs &amp;lsquo;chips&amp;rsquo; may require different methods to connect
the chip to the Pi. As shown in the &lt;a href="https://pi4j.com/examples/communityimplementation/bmp280/">BMP280 usage&lt;/a>
a chip maybe available mounted on a small circuit board where connection to the Pi
requires only jumpers. But even this simple means has limits as connecting several
chips when using a Pi case and maybe a cooling fan creates problems. In addition
some chips are only available as a socket device where a 4-28 pin socket is
required. This next section demonstrates &amp;lsquo;a&amp;rsquo; way these limits can be overcome.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
