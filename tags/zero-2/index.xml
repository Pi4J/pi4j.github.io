&lt;p&gt;As described before on &lt;a href="https://pi4j.com/blog/2025/20250625-java-21-not-working-on-zero-2/"&gt;Java 21+ Not Working on Zero 2&lt;/a&gt;, a problem appeared to execute Java code on the Raspberry Pi Zero 2 with OpenJDK 21 or higher. Reason: in OpenJDK 21 the Just-In-Time (JIT) compiler has been improved, but this change doesn’t work correctly on the ARM Cortex-A53 processor as used in the Zero 2. It&amp;rsquo;s another type of processor compared to, for instance, the Raspberry Pi 4 (Cortex-A72) and 5 (Cortex-A76).&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Java 21+ Not Working on Zero 2</title><link>https://pi4j.com/blog/2025/20250625-java-21-not-working-on-zero-2/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://pi4j.com/blog/2025/20250625-java-21-not-working-on-zero-2/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;2025-06-25 by Frank Delporte&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dieter Holz&lt;/strong&gt; was experimenting with Pi4J V3 on a Raspberry Pi Zero 2. Because this version requires Java 21 or newer, he upgraded his OS to a newer Java version and found out that no Java code could be executed. He tried with Java 21 and 24, and neither worked correctly, although Java 17 runs without problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same SD card with Java 24 that didn&amp;rsquo;t work on the Zero 2 worked perfectly on a Raspberry Pi 4. So, what is happening under the hood? What is the difference between these two boards causing this problem? Let&amp;rsquo;s dive in.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
