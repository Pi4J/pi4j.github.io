On the Pi5, Pi kernel updates result in the PWM failing. The
exception details will state /sys/class/pwm/pwmchip2/npwm was not found.

A kernel code update (6.12)  resulted in the objects within /sys/class/pwm
being numbered differently.  It is most likely the PWM is using
/sys/class/pwm/pwmchip0.

Until a proper fix is available the following change to your application
should resolve this error.

```

Added imports
import com.pi4j.plugin.linuxfs.provider.pwm.LinuxFsPwmProvider;
import com.pi4j.plugin.linuxfs.provider.pwm.LinuxFsPwmProviderImpl;

Replace newAutoContext
// Context pi4j = Pi4J.newAutoContext();

Context pi4j = Pi4J.newContextBuilder()
           .add(new LinuxFsPwmProviderImpl("/sys/class/pwm/",0) )
            .build();

```
